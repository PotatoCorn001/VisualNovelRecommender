He received his Master of Fine Arts from the Tokyo National University of Fine Arts and Music. His works have an edgy style due to, among other things, his not using a ruler while drawing as is usual for most anime-style art. He first gained fame in his work on the avant-garde anime Serial Experiments Lain. He is also responsible for the concept and character design for the series NieA under 7. He is the creator of the doujinshi Haibane Renmei, which was then adapted into an anime.\n\n[From [url=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yoshitoshi_ABe]Wikipedia[/url]]	http://abworks.blog83.fc2.com/	abfly	0	0	0	0	0	\N	\N

She is married to anime director and animator Hirata Tomohiro, with whom she also collaborated in the Trinity Blood anime (in which Nakajima was character designer and Hirata was director).\n\nNakajima is strongly associated with the animated adaptations of the works of Takahashi Rumiko produced by Kitty Films, having worked as an animation director on Urusei Yatsura, Ranma 1/2 and Maison Ikkoku and as a character designer on Ranma 1/2.\n\n[From [url=http://anidb.net/perl-bin/animedb.pl?show=creator&creatorid=1419]AniDB[/url]]		_7265687568142	0	0	0	0	0	\N	\N

After working on several famous TV productions and OVAs such as Ranma, he quit being animator and began working as game designer and illustrator, first with doujin games and later establishing an own company, [url=https://vndb.org/p2404]Silence[/url], which produced commercial games. The company focused on producing games which had actually animated scenes, by famous active animators, as such their games became instantly a hit in sales and allowed the studio to purchase an own building and establish several brands, such as [url=https://vndb.org/p461]Sogna[/url]. Most notably amongst its games was the Viper series, which had a large cult following. However, the one-man management of the firm and the latest part from the Viper series, VIPER-M3 3.2, which was for some four years in the making and had a troubling production schedule, contributed greatly to Sogna's financial dilemma and eventual downfall. After the announcement of the game in 1999, it was finally released in 2003 but the Sogna brand was forced to close soon after and Silence disappeared in 2004 and together with it did Nakamura. In 2007 he made a comeback as animator on the TV remake of Dancougar.\n\n[From [url=http://anidb.net/perl-bin/animedb.pl?show=creator&creatorid=10227]AniDB[/url]]			0	0	0	0	0	\N	\N

Originally the only official members, the two utilized several support musicians until bassist Tsui, keyboardist Yuhki, and drummer Jun-ichi officially joined for the release of their debut album in 2003. Yama-B left the group in 2008 citing musical differences, and Yu-To, who replaced Tsui in 2006, left the following year. Galneryus then recruited Sho on vocals and Taka on bass, who still remain as their current members.	http://galneryusyumacher.com/	GALNERYUSOFFIC2	0	0	0	0	0	\N	\N

The band's sound is described as calm and soothing "organic pop", most likely because they use very few synthesized instruments and the main instrument is an acoustic guitar. On November 25, 2014, the group announced that they will be going on an indefinite hiatus.  Their last live concert was on February 15, 2015. \n\nBlog: http://ameblo.jp/marble-officialblog/\nNews Twitter: https://twitter.com/marble_tatsuya	http://shop.funfantoday.com/marble/	marble_livelife	0	0	0	0	0	\N	\N

She was the first to pick up a historic theme in her highly acclaimed "Versailles no Bara" and did other impressive historical works.\n\nShe is included in Year 24 Group.\n\nIt's rumored she had an affair with a politician and Ikeda disappeared from the manga-scene around the mid-80's. However she returned at the end of 1998 again with "Orpheus no Mado Gaiden".\n\nIn 2008 Ikeda received France's Ordre national de la Légion d'honneur.\n\n[From [url=https://myanimelist.net/people/2912/Riyoko_Ikeda]MyAnimeList[/url]]	http://www.ikeda-riyoko-pro.com/		0	0	0	0	0	\N	\N

s15270	m	ja	19169	868	551359	0	Nagai Gou is an iconic mangaka and perhaps one of the biggest influences in the world of manga and anime overall.\n\nIn 1968, Shueisha was about to release its first manga publication - Shounen Jump, and Nagai was invited as one of the first mangakas to publish their work there. He accepted and while it was his first long running series, it was a huge success, making Shounen Jump sell over one million copies. Name of the series was Harenchi Gakuen and with it, Nagai was the first to introduce eroticism in modern manga and became the creator of modern erotic manga. Harenchi Gakuen completely changed the common perception of manga as well as what would be appropriate to convey with it. Bluntly said, Nagai Gou is the main reason why majority of western folks think that manga and anime are nothing more than cartoon porn.\n\nIn 1970, Nagai Gou started a company, Dynamic Production, to fund his manga and anime ventures. Dynamic Production's first titles were Getter Robo and Abashiri Ikka.  [From [url=http://anidb.net/perl-bin/animedb.pl?show=creator&creatorid=868]AniDB[/url]]			0	0	0	0	0	\N	\N

He was Senior Vice President of Software Development at Square Enix (formerly Square) and the head of the company's Product Development Division-3. He is best known as the former lead developer of Final Fantasy XI, Square's first massively multiplayer online role playing game (MMORPG). He oversaw ongoing development of that title and Final Fantasy XIV until late 2010. He also worked in a prominent role for earlier single-player games including Secret of Mana, Seiken Densetsu 3, Xenogears, Threads of Fate, Chrono Cross, and the Nintendo DS version of Final Fantasy III. (Tanaka had also worked on the original Famicon version of Final Fantasy III in 1990).\n\nIn 1983, Tanaka dropped out of Yokohama National University along with Hironobu Sakaguchi to join Square, a newly formed software branch of the Denyuusha Electric Company. Along with Sakaguchi and Kazuhiko Aoki, Tanaka was part of Square's original Planning and Development department.\n\nFinal Fantasy XIV received a hostile reception from critics and players, and was considered a financial disaster for Square Enix. Three months after its release in 2010, Tanaka was removed from the Final Fantasy XIV team and replaced by Naoki Yoshida. At the Vana'diel Fan Festival 2012, a festival celebrating Final Fantasy XI's 10th anniversary, Tanaka announced his departure from Square Enix due to health reasons. In 2012, Tanaka joined GungHo Online Entertainment as a freelance adviser to the company.\n\n[From [url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hiromichi_Tanaka]Wikipedia[/url]]			0	0	0	0	0	\N	\N

The group includes over 130 members as of December 2015, aged from their early teens to their mid-20s.[5][6] AKB48's producer, Yasushi Akimoto, wanted to form a girl group with its own theater (unlike pop groups performing occasional concerts and seen on television) and performing daily so fans could always see them live.[7] This "idols you can meet" concept includes teams[8] which can rotate performances and perform simultaneously at several events[9] and "handshake" events, where fans can meet group members. Akimoto has expanded the AKB48 concept to several sister groups in China, Japan, Indonesia, Thailand, Taiwan and the Philippines with upcoming groups announced for India and Vietnam.\n\nThe group is one of the highest-earning musical performers in Japan. In 2012, their sales reached $226 million. AKB48 has been characterized as a social phenomenon. As of June 2018, the group has sold over 56 million records, including over 6 million albums. AKB48 is the highest selling musical act in Japan in terms of singles sold. AKB48's thirty-five latest singles have topped the Oricon Weekly Singles Chart, with thirty singles selling over a million copies each. Their highest selling single, "Teacher Teacher", sold over 2.9 million in 2018 according to Billboard / Soundscan. In 2010, "Beginner" and "Heavy Rotation" placed first and second, respectively, on the list of Japan's best-selling singles for the year. From 2011 to 2017, AKB48's singles have occupied the top four or five spots of the Oricon Yearly Singles Chart.	https://www.akb48.co.jp/	AKB48	0	0	0	0	0	\N	\N

s17248	m	ja	21597	\N	\N	0	Kenkou Cross (健康クロス, Kenkō Kurosu) is one of the lead artists in the game [url=https://vndb.org/v5657]Monster Girl Quest[/url], most notable for his design of [url=https://vndb.org/c4287]Alice[/url] and two of the slimes ([url=https://vndb.org/c125093]Slime Girl[/url], the first enemy encountered, and the Heavenly Knight [url=https://vndb.org/c5267]Erubetie[/url]). Cross’ work usually revolves around humanoid-shaped monster girls, although his MGQ-based work consists of slimes and the lamia-like Alice.\n\nNotably, Cross is also credited with the Monster Girl Encyclopedia series, which details female versions of fictional and mythological monsters.\n\nAlthough not being a part of the Monster Girl Quest game it’s believed to be a particular source of inspiration for the game makers as one of the initial higher-profile, monster girl based projects. A proposed game based around the project is also in the early development stages. Few other details are known, however the battle system seems to rely more on a party rather than a sole protagonist.\n\n[From [url=https://mgq.miraheze.org/wiki/Category:Artist:_Kenkou_Cross]Mon-musu Quest Wiki[/url]]	http://kurobine.sakura.ne.jp/	k_cross	0	0	0	0	0	\N	\N

He performs under the stage name T.M.Revolution (TMR), which stands for "Takanori Makes Revolution" (貴教が革命を起こす Takanori ga kakumei o okosu), stemming from the famous '80s pop electronic band TM Network. Despite most of his songs being written by Akio Inoue and composed/arranged by Daisuke Asakura (also TMR's former producer), T.M.Revolution is considered Nishikawa's solo project. Nishikawa is also known for contributions of ending and opening themes to many notable anime and game series.\n\nNishikawa debuted as TMR with the release of his first single "Dokusai (Monopolize)" (独裁 -monopolize-) in May 1996. Later that year, his third single "Heart of Sword (Yoake Mae)" (HEART OF SWORD ～夜明け前～) was used as the third ending song for the anime series Rurouni Kenshin, further expanding his fan base. He also contributed six songs to the Mobile Suit Gundam SEED franchise – three for Gundam SEED and three for Gundam SEED Destiny. Nishikawa has guest starred as a minor character in each of those anime series that featured his songs. In 2010, his single "Save the One, Save the All" was used as the ending theme song for the movie Bleach: Hell Verse. Nishikawa has also had a long-standing affair with Capcom's Sengoku Basara series of video games and media franchise, with several of his songs being used for it, including Crosswise and Flags.\n\nT.M.Revolution is the first artist to be signed to Tofu Records, a record label (affiliated with Sony Music Japan) promoting Japanese artists in North America. Tofu released three of his most recent studio albums: coordinate (2003), Seventh Heaven (2004), and vertical infinity (2005).	http://www.tm-revolution.com/	TMR15	0	0	0	0	0	\N	\N

After some personnel changes in the late 1980s, the band gained international fame as a duo consisting of Konishi and vocalist Maki Nomiya. The group, widely credited (along with Flipper's Guitar) for spearheading the Shibuya-kei movement of Tokyo in the 1990s, is known for electric and energetic compositions that often pay homage to late 1960s English-language pop music. The catchphrase "A New Stereophonic Sound Spectacular" captured the group's ironic stance and eager attitude.\n\nPizzicato Five was a hugely prolific group during its existence, usually releasing at least an album each year in addition to various EPs and remix albums. Their music has appeared in numerous movies, television episodes, and video games.	http://columbia.jp/~pizzicato/		0	0	0	0	0	\N	\N

Such examples are [url=https://vndb.org/c126292]Bee[/url][url=https://vndb.org/c126293]lze[/url][url=https://vndb.org/c126294]bubs[/url] and [url=https://vndb.org/c125481]Tarantula Girl[/url] who have breasts in unlikely places, or [url=https://vndb.org/c126261]Poseidoness[/url] who combines the elements of various sea life.\n\nIn general, Setouchi’s work revolves around insects and creatures with tentacles, although there are exceptions to this rule, binding elements are always abound.\n\nNext to working on this game, Setouchi is also making dōjinshi revolving around monster girls.\n\n[From [url=https://mgq.miraheze.org/wiki/Category:Artist:_Setouchi]Mon-musu Quest Wiki[/url]]	http://setouchi.cheap.jp/	blackse	0	0	0	0	0	\N	\N

Another notable area are his use of big bright eyes with attention to detail with the iris.\n\n[From [url=https://mgq.miraheze.org/wiki/Category:Artist:_Jingai_Modoki]Mon-musu Quest Wiki[/url]]		youkaidou	0	0	0	0	0	\N	\N

Total sales of the singles he has written exceed 37.9 million copies, making him the fifth best-selling lyricist in Japan.\n\nHe is best known for having two major roles in the Japanese music landscape: first as the lead singer of the popular rock group Sharam Q, and now as the producer, primary composer, lyricist, and (until 2014) primary studio backing vocalist for highly popular idol group Morning Musume, in addition to Aya Matsuura and other associated idols under the Hello! Project banner, for whom he has written and produced the vast majority of their chart-topping hits. He has also produced music for other Japanese artists, including Ayumi Hamasaki's first number one single.[3] As his musical influences he cites The Beatles, Japanese popular music (especially kayōkyoku), American and European hits being played on the radio when he was a schoolboy, disco acts such as Chic, Kool & the Gang and Earth, Wind & Fire, and bands like Duran Duran and The Power Station.\n\n[From [url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tsunku]Wikipedia[/url]]	https://www.tsunku.net/	tsunkuboy	0	0	0	0	0	\N	\N

As a student, Mamoru Oshii was fascinated by the film La Jetée by Chris Marker as well as the films of Andrzej Wajda, Jerzy Kawalerowicz, Andrzej Munk and Ingmar Bergman.\n\nIn 1976, he graduated from The Fine Arts Education School of the Education Department of Tokyo Liberal Arts University. The following year, he entered Tatsunoko Productions and worked on his first anime as animation director on Ippatsu Kanta-kun. In 1980, he moved to Studio Pierrot under the supervision of his mentor, Hisayuki Toriumi. During production of the Nils no Fushigina Tabi and Kagaku Ninja-Tai Gatchaman II TV series, Oshii first met longtime collaborator, writer Kazunori Itou, and painter and character designer Yoshitaka Amano.\n\nIn the midst of his work with Studio Pierrot, Oshii took on independent work and directed the first direct-to-video OVA series, Dallos, in 1983. In 1984, he left Studio Pierrot and has remained independent ever since. He next wrote and directed Tenshi no Tamago (Angel's Egg) released in 1985, a surreal film with biblical themes featuring the character designs of Yoshitaka Amano.\n\nIn 1995, Mamoru Oshii released his landmark animated cyberpunk film, Ghost in the Shell, in Japan, the United States, and Europe. It hit the top of the US Billboard video charts in 1996, making it the first anime video ever to do so.\n\nAfter a 5-year hiatus from directing to work on other projects, Oshii returned to live-action with the long-awaited Japanese-Polish feature Avalon, which was shown at the Cannes Film Festival in 2001. His next animated feature film, Innocence (a sequel to Ghost in the Shell), was selected to compete at the 2004 Cannes Film Festival for the coveted Palme d'Or prize, making it the first anime in this top category and only the eighth animated film to be shown at Cannes. His most recent film, The Sky Crawlers, competed for the Golden Lion in the Venice Film Festival and won the Future Film Festival Digital Award.\n\nIn terms of directing, Oshii has stated his approach is directly opposite the Hollywood formula. For Mamoru Oshii, the visuals are the most important aspect, then the story and the characters come last. \n\nSource: AniDB	http://oshiimamoru.com/	oshii_mamoru	0	0	0	0	0	\N	\N

The origin of my nickname Sheepy was given to me by my friends after they found out my last name, and I adopted the nickname as my brand with my work in literature and game development.

My name is Melissa King, but you can call me Mel, or The Fuboo. 37 years young, married 19 years, mother of three and full time nerd. Yeah, I just called myself out on that so you wouldn't. HA!\n     I've been drawing since I was 4 years old, seeing a lady draw a Pegasus for me while I was at work with my dad at an Air force Base. I thought the drawing was so amazing, I wanted to draw one just like hers or even better.\n     Sadly, my memory is very fuzzy since that day, so I'm not sure if I achieved this goal or not.\nHowever, I do have my own illustrating company and an independent artist for hire.\nSo, hey, I'd say I'm doing pretty good!"\n\n[From [url=http://www.invertedmindinc.com/]Inverted Mind INC.[/url]]	https://www.patreon.com/Inverted_Mind_INC	Y0ur_B0yfriend	0	0	0	0	0	\N	\N

s24480	m	en	30338	\N	\N	0	From his website: Eli grew up in Virginia beach, he learned the value of joy early in life. He’ve always felt he was born to make others smile, and for a while he thought he’d do that through public speaking. However, after several events and a few hundred miles on the road he started to wonder if there was another way for him to bring a smile to people’s faces. Spurred on by childhood memories and an adoration for my role model, James Arnold Taylor, he found himself pursuing a career in voiceover. His energy and ability to command a room translated well into his new craft, and the passion he once emanated on stage was now being channeled into a microphone. The way he use his voice may vary, but the effort he put forth is always consistent. It is his goal to always leave the listener satisfied and with a smile on their face.	https://www.elifarmer.com/	@theelifarmer	0	0	0	0	0	\N	\N

I have appeared onstage and behind the mic for ADR and non-ADR VO projects alike.\nI'm looking forward to one day getting in front of a camera!\n\nIn addition to acting, I can sing (including jazz/pop/b'way) and dance (including ballroom/jazz/ballet) in various styles.\n\nI believe we never stop learning and I consistently take classes to further hone my craft any chance I can get.\nI love expanding my mind and my skills.\nAside from acting, I enjoy drawing, writing, reading and anything else creative.\n\nI am currently studying Japanese and am semi-fluent in Latin.\n\nFrom https://dezzievox.carrd.co/#about	https://dezzievox.carrd.co/	@dezzievox	0	0	0	0	0	\N	\N

s28494	m	en	35226	\N	\N	0	I began as a musician, playing drums and percussion throughout middle school and high school. As I began to branch out into other artistic pursuits, I discovered a love of creating music and audio for games that evolved into a passion for game development more broadly. I am now studying Interactive Entertainment with prospective minors in Game Audio and Occupational Science at the University of Southern California.\n\nI am an energetic and excited game developer with specialties in audio design and technical game design. I love creating game mechanics and interactive audio/music systems that help to create powerful and compelling player experiences. With the additional lens of a minor in Occupational Science, I have the opportunity to use my passion for psychology to understand how games can help players live happier, healthier lives. Some of my favorite games include The Beginner's Guide, ABZÛ, and Hellblade: Senua's Sacrifice.	https://www.zachnorthrop.com/		0	0	0	0	0	\N	\N	
s28495	f	en	35227	\N	\N	0	I'm currently a second-year undergrad lucky enough to be attending the University of Southern California, where the game design program has been named #1 in North America by the Princeton Review nearly every year since 2010. I've loved games ever since my dad got me hooked on World of Warcraft when I was young, and though I always thought I'd pursue the engineering side of things, storytelling is my biggest passion and ultimately what I want to do.\n\n​\n\nWriting isn't everything, though. At USC Games, I've had the opportunity to learn about nearly every aspect of game making, from sound design, to engineering, to 3D modeling, business, and more. Knowing at least a little about each of these areas has made me more well-rounded as a general game developer and facilitated much smoother cooperation with my fellow developers.\n\n \n\nAt USC, I'm a member of EscapeSC, the school's premier escape room club where we design, playtest, and gamemaster online and in-person escape rooms, as well as Trojan Adventuring Party (TAP), a TTRPG club where I DM D&D 5e. I recently finished my second campaign with TAP, and am excited to start a third this fall! I'm also a student leader of Progressive Christians @ USC and a member of the Makers of Entertaining Games Association (MEGA)\n\n \n\nAs for hobbies, I enjoy creative writing (which I suppose is kind of work, but kind of not). I am also legally obligated as a game developer to enjoy games. Some of my favourite games are Death's Door, Apex Legends, Star Wars: KOTOR, and The Last of Us. I also enjoy watching Critical Role, RWBY, and drum corps/indoor percussion shows.	https://www.melodyxwang.com/	@melodyxwang02	0	0	0	0	0	\N	\N

At some point in 2016, I decided that I wanted to move on to Character Art. Since then I juggled improving my Character Art while I took commissions as a Background Artist to sustain myself. Thanks to that, I was able to slowly transition to a Character Artist.[/quote]\n\n[From [url=https://www.patreon.com/sendrawz]Patreon[/url]]	https://www.patreon.com/sendrawz	sendrawz	0	0	0	0	0	\N	\N

s31891	m	fr	39055	\N	\N	0	[quote]François Couture is a multidisciplinary musician who stands out because of his great versatility and solid experience in the field. François first studied classical and jazz guitar at Cégep de Drummondville with Jean-Paul Rajotte and Aurèle Lacombe and also took composition and arrangement lessons from Richard Ferland. He went on to study composition and writing at Conservatoire de musique de Québec, this time with Pierick Houdy, Pierre Genest and Pierre Normandin.\n\nFrançois also has many other skills. He is a guitarist, arranger, orchestrator, sound designer, producer, musical director and sound engineer. Over the course of his busy career, he has received numerous commissions for major events.\n\nHis discography features rich and daring works that highlight Canada’s musical heritage. They are in fact intense collaborations with Aboriginal musicians, Inuit throat singers, string quartets, classical orchestras and choirs, along with fiddlers, folk artists and step dancers. Always with the aim of satisfying his love of discovery, François continues to develop his art and his experience of traditional, Aboriginal, classical, jazz and electronic music by working with artists from home and abroad.[/quote]\n\n[From his [url=http://www.studiofc.com/bio.html]official website[/url]]	http://www.studiofc.com/		0	0	0	0	0	\N	\N

He’s called “The God of Paizuri” by his fans and he’s one of the major representatives of the new style of paizuri that is spreading in Japan (that kind of paizuri where girls don’t take their clothes off).\n\nArekishi’s works are ideal for people who like lolita characters with huge breasts, as well as people who don’t consider tit fucking to be foreplay, but rather the main dish. \n\n[From [url=https://mgq.miraheze.org/wiki/Category:Artist:_Arekishi]Mon-musu Quest Wiki[/url]]	http://kakuretenai.blog103.fc2.com/	palexi	0	0	0	0	0	\N	\N

Long an admirer of the creative arts, he always aspired to write in third-person on his website about how much he wants to give the world stories worth telling, and on any team, he is a hard worker and invested team player.\n\n​A voice actor since 2011, Tom provides class and versatility for character and commercial work, booking with clients from around the world such as Disney, JEEP, Sound Cadence, and more from the comfort of his home thanks to patching services such as Source Connect and Discord. If you've played Wasteland 3 or Lethal League Blaze, you might just already know what those years of experience have done for him...\n\n...and what they can do for you!\n\n[From [url=https://www.tomschalkarts.com/about-me]Official site[/url]]	https://www.tomschalkarts.com/	@TomStheVoice	0	0	0	0	0	\N	\N

s33182	m	ja	40554	\N	\N	2130	Thomas has been an artist commissioned for the Monster Girl Quest series since Chapter 2. In the game his art is featured moderately with depictions of a few boss characters. Outside of MGQ, Thomas’s art has been released in some hentai which includes "Jingai Shunman", a series of short stories centered around various monster girls.\n\nThomas’s art is characterized by a very “graphic novel” style with bold black lineart and stark colors. Similar to some of his own releases he seems to focus on insect-like monsters or monsters of an artificial nature.\n\nIt is also notable that Thomas’s art also has a bug where parts of the art become transparent before fading away. \n\n[From [url=https://mgq.miraheze.org/wiki/Category:Artist:_Thomas]Mon-musu Quest Wiki[/url]]		irontom00	0	0	0	0	0	\N	\N

s34902	m	en	42799	\N	\N	0	Sterling (he/him) is a Filipino-American, transgender voice actor based in Richmond, Virginia. He was born with the dream of becoming a storyteller.\nAlthough he has played the quiet kid, he will not hold back when duty calls! From sorrowful to saccharine, he offers a wide range of youthful and ageless voices. Protagonists and antagonists alike are vessels for Sterling's powerful performances.\nHis acting approach is to not hide his true self, but to rather embrace each diverse role and nurture them into his identity.\nWhen not behind the mic, Sterling can be found acting at Kings Dominion amusement park, adventuring in D&D, or cuddling with his two cats: Thai and Janie.\n\n- from https://sterlingbarbett.com/	https://sterlingbarbett.com/	sterlingbarbett	0	0	0	0	0	\N	\N

Not much is known about her, but she is (or was) affiliated with TILDE and a friend/coworker of REIKA. \n**Info on erogamescape is wrong!! She is NOT Faylan because Reika mentions on her blog that said MASAMI has a child (https://ameblo.jp/reika-kun/entry-12260467367.html), and there are pictures of her. Faylan also doesn't mention REIKA, Kemopani! or Furufuru Panic on her blog... also, I listened to the song several times and it's clearly not Faylan, even when she sings more cutely. \n\nI couldn't find more info on this Masami, though!			0	0	0	0	0	\N	\N
