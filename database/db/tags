g513	ero	0	t	t	Netorare	NTR\n寝取られ	This visual novel has scenes focused on Netorare. Netorare is more than a simple act of infidelity, but the fetishization of jealousy and other negative feelings commonly associated with it.\n\nFor a game to be classified as Netorare the following conditions must be met:\n\n1. The protagonist's significant other, a very close friend, or in some cases, a close relative is stolen from him by someone seducing, coercing, blackmailing, outright raping them, or by using other techniques. It doesn't necessarily mean that they are literally stolen, but the negative feelings experienced by their significant other might make it seem so.\n\n2. The one who loses their loved one almost always finds out about the situation and suffers from jealousy and the feeling of helplessness arisen from an inability to change anything. The one stealing the lover and/or the stolen loved one might rub it in by humiliating the loser in private or in public.\n\n3. The trait does [b]not[/b] apply if the character having sex with someone else does not have a close loving relationship with the protagonist, and if the protagonist does not experience jealousy and other negative feelings upon finding out about the act. In other words, the ties between the partners and their forcible separation is important to the netorare fetish. For example, an unrequited crush or a potential hero(ine) on a different route would not count for the purposes of this fetish.\n\n4. The act of stealing must happen while the protagonist is in a relationship with the stolen significant other. Scenes of heroine's past relationships do not count as Netorare.\n\nThe game is usually portrayed from the perspective of someone losing his significant other, in order to delve deep into the jealousy aspect of the fetish, however, for story purposes the game might switch between multiple POVs and also portray the events from the perspective of the stolen SO.
g514	ero	0	t	t	Netori		Netori is a counterpart tag to [url=/g513]Netorare[/url], however instead of playing as someone who has his significant lover stolen, you play as the one doing the stealing.\n\nRather than fetishizing jealousy and other negative feelings, Netori is a power trip of pulling one over another person and taking something that is theirs.\n\nFor a game to be classified as Netori, the following conditions must be met:\n\n1. The protagonist steals the significant other, a very close friend, or in extremely rare cases, a close relative from another character by seducing, coercing, blackmailing, outright raping them, or by using other techniques.\n\n2. The character stolen must be someone you are not supposed to steal. As an example, the protagonist having sex with someone's mother wouldn't be Netori, if she doesn't have a significant other. However, it would become Netori if she is the protagonist's own mother, and the father is present in the game in some form.\n\n3. For Netori-themed games the finding out aspect is less important, as the game focuses on the protagonist and his conquest. Still, the losing character needs to exist within the game and play some role related to his SO being stolen. If the losing character does not appear or is barely mentioned, the game should be tagged with [url=/g1380]Infidelity[/url] instead of Netori.\n\n4. The trait does not apply if the protagonist's conquest does not have a close loving relationship with another character, as ties between the partners and their forcible separation by the protagonist is important aspect of the fetish.

Typically anger and proximity (or actuality) of death only strengthen the characters, allowing them to draw out unfathomable power.\nBattles employing this plot device can typically always end either way, since there are objectively virtually no restrictions on the number of times you can power up with yet another attack more powerful than the last one you took.\n\nFor example:\nAs the hero gets beaten by the story's archvillain, he remembers a move his kung fu master taught him and uses it to take down his adversary.\nThe archvillain, baffled by this situation, gets angrier and turns into a demon which in turn beats down the hero.\nHero gets a sudden blessing from his dead-childhood-friend-turn-angel and blasts the demon with holy fire.\nIn response to that the demon-archvillain grabs a mecha, that was conveniently lying where he fell (or summons one out of thin air), and fuses with it to become an archvillain-demon-mecha and disintegrates the hero with laser beams.\nFollowing this the hero has a long scene about his past, friends, family, etc., which somehow renews his will and rouses him back from the dead as a super-human-angel-blessed-kung-fu guy and...\n\nIn short something like this good old [url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16uevTBhgV4&feature=related]metallic knights[/url] movie.

Office ladies are usually full-time permanent staff, although the jobs they do usually have little opportunity for promotion, and there is usually the tacit expectation that they leave their jobs once they get married.\n\nOften nicknamed shokuba no hana or "office flower", these women suffer discrimination due to the M-Curve. Office ladies are usually hired right after high school or junior high, with university graduates discouraged from pursuing this type of career. They are kept around the office for the youth they bring to it, hence the "flower" nickname. They are charged with routine, menial tasks meant to support the male workers. This type of career offers very little chance of advancement and was specifically designed so that women would leave for marriage before their thirties. Women between the ages of twenty four and twenty eight often are advised to settle down as a subtle message to quit, as those years are considered the most suitable for marriage.

They just need to act like a tsukkomi in their everyday life and interact with characters displaying boke traits. For example, they may often retort at the comical misunderstandings of the other characters.\n\nSimilar in execution to the concepts of "funny man" and "straight man" in double act comedy, boke and tsukkomi are a very important characteristic of manzai (Japanese style of comedy). Boke comes from the verb bokeru which carries the meaning of "senility" or "air headed-ness" and is reflected in the boke's tendency for misinterpretation and forgetfulness. The word tsukkomi refers to the role the second comedian plays in "butting in" and correcting the boke's errors. In performances it is common for the tsukkomi to berate the boke and hit them on the head with a swift smack; one traditional manzai prop often used for this purpose is a pleated paper fan.\n\nSee [url=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manzai]Wikipedia[/url] and [url=http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BokeAndTsukkomiRoutine]tvtropes[/url] for further reading.

Microtransactions are extremely common in "free-to-play" games, leading to the term "freemium" to describe them. They are most often found in games on mobile platforms, but are not exclusive to them.\n\nRather than paying for content directly, games with microtransactions often require the player to buy amounts of a "premium" currency, which is then exchanged for the content that they want.\n\nIn visual novels, microtransactions can be implemented in any or all of the following ways (this list is not exhaustive):\n\n1. The player can only read a certain amount of the VN in a single day, but can pay to read more. This is often represented by a "tickets" system in VNs, or a "stamina" or "energy" gauge in other types of games.\n\n2. When the player comes to a choice point, the "best" choice requires the player to pay to select it. This may simply unlock a CG or may be required for a good ending.\n\n3. The player can use money/premium currency to draw random content (side stories, game items, game currency, etc) from a pool. Use g2711 for games that include this mechanic.\n\nDo not use this tag for games which have a free prologue then allow you to buy individual routes (these are functionally identical to a demo and a paid game) or for games which have paid side stories or similar bonus content (these are just normal DLC) unless they also contain another type of microtransaction mechanic.

g3495	ero	0	t	t	Bimbofication	Gyarufication\nGangurofication\nBimboification\nGyaruka\nギャル化	This visual novel features character(s) that are subjected to bimbofication. Bimbofication is a type of [url=/g3105]Sexual Corruption[/url], which results in the character becoming a [url=/i3547]Bimbo[/url]. The affected character is usually initially described as innocent/prude, smart, diligent, or simply unassuming, however the circumstances align to turn them into an oversexed sexpot, usually known as a [url=/i3547]Bimbo[/url]. The usual changes experienced by the character are these:\n\n1. Looks: Character starts dressing in revealing and eye-catching clothing, wear gaudy make-up and lots of fashion accessories, dye their hair (blonde colour dominates, but other variations are possible). Frequently bimbos employ plastic surgery to enhance their looks. Tattoos and piercing are also occasionally proudly displayed.\n\n2. Outlook: The character starts craving hedonistic activities and frequently participates in parties and other social gatherings. They usually become sexually [url=/g1667]promiscuous[/url] and start having sex with multiple partners. They might even get involved in sex work.\n\n3. Intelligence: In fantasy/sci-fi settings the character usually is subjected to mental degradation that somehow decreases their intelligence. In real world setting, the character reprioritizes their lifestyle, usually dropping out of school, retiring from work, in order to seek a more hedonistic and social lifestyle. Drug use and abuse is also pretty common in such works.\n\nA particular variation of the trope present in Japan is Gyarufication (and by extension Gangurofication), where a normal high school girl (or a young woman) usually falls in with a bad crowd, and over the course of the game starts displaying looks and attitude associated with the negative [url=/i1219]Gyaru[/url] / [url=/i1054]Ganguro[/url] stereotypes. The usual bimbo tropes of changing the looks, becoming morally lax, seeking hedonistic activities and sex, and not caring about studies or work tend to apply. Their lifestyle tends to be costly and will often lead to enjo-kousai and prostitution.\n\n[i]Do NOT use this tag if the affected character is already a bimbo/gyaru/ganguro or they're already morally lax, corrupted at the beginning of the story.[/i]\n\nExamples of Bimbofication\n\n[url=https://s2.vndb.org/sf/02/158002.jpg]1[/url], [url=https://s2.vndb.org/sf/04/158004.jpg]2[/url], [url=https://s2.vndb.org/sf/05/158005.jpg]3[/url]\n\nExamples of Gyarufication / Gangurofication\n\n[url=https://s2.vndb.org/sf/06/158006.jpg]1[/url], [url=https://s2.vndb.org/sf/07/158007.jpg]2[/url]

Boke comes from the verb bokeru which carries the meaning of "senility" or "air headed-ness" and is reflected in the boke's tendency for misinterpretation and forgetfulness. The word tsukkomi refers to the role the second comedian plays in "butting in" and correcting the boke's errors. In performances it is common for the tsukkomi to berate the boke and hit them on the head with a swift smack; one traditional manzai prop often used for this purpose is a pleated paper fan.\n\nSee [url=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manzai]Wikipedia[/url] and [url=http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BokeAndTsukkomiRoutine]tvtropes[/url] for further reading.

Usually player should decide on his own what to do next, where to go, what events to do in what order.\n\nMain characteristics of the genre are a calendar (i.e. time management), map movement, various resources and statistics you need to gather and level up, repeatable events which often can have various upgrades/continuations depending on how many times you did them before, new unlockable events depending on various conditions etc.\n\nA key difference from pure [url=/g39]Dating Simulation[/url] or [url=/g40]Raising Simulation[/url] games is that the sandbox is not necessarily about dates/romance, and various parameters you need to level up are not focused exclusively on a protagonist or on other characters, though elements of those genres may be present. The most common example are various corruption games.\n\n[b]While VNs with sandbox elements are allowed in the database, sandboxes with brief VN elements are not.[/b]\n\nVNs such as [url=/v22826]Insexual Awakening[/url] are a good example of that genre.
