In addition there are often irregular serrations that lead the back edge of the blade to the spike. The blade is mounted atop a 1.5 m to 1.8 m long wooden or metal pole with a pointed metal counter weight used to balance the heavy blade and for striking on the opposite end. The blade is very deeply curved and therefore unlike most polearms, solely useful for sweeping cuts where it relies on range and power.

The snaith has either one or two short handles at right angles to it – usually one near the upper end and always another roughly in the middle. A long, curved blade about 60 to 90 centimetres long is mounted at the lower end, perpendicular to the snaith. Scythes always have the blade projecting from the left side of the snaith when in use, with the edge towards the mower. In principle a left-handed scythe could be made, but it could not be used together with right-handed scythes in a team of mowers, as the left-handed mower would be mowing in the opposite direction.

The idea of attaching a weapon onto a long shaft is an old one, as the first spears date back to the Stone Age. The purpose of using pole weapons is either to extend reach or to increase angular momentum—and thus striking power—when the weapon is swung.\n\nThis trait is intended to be used for made up or unidentified types of pole weapons that are not mentioned above, for those use (or make) the appropriate trait.

Any broad, flat surface waved back-and-forth will create a small airflow and therefore can be considered a rudimentary fan. But generally, purpose-made hand-held fans are shaped like a sector of a circle and made of a thin material (such as paper or feathers) mounted on slats which revolve around a pivot so that it can be closed when not in use.\n\nThe movement of a hand-held fan provides cooling by increasing the airflow over the skin which in turn increases the evaporation rate of sweat droplets on the skin. This evaporation has a cooling effect due to the latent heat of evaporation of water. Fans are convenient to carry around, especially folding fans.
i601	i41	0	0	f	t	t	Gardening	Horticulture	This character engages in [url=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gardening]gardening[/url].\n\nGardening is the practice of growing plants.

It involves an active participation in the growing of plants, and tends to be labor intensive, which differentiates it from farming or forestry.

The greatsword, and perhaps longswords in this manner, were not a form of "specialized weapon" as much as they were "outsize(d) specimens". Indeed, the weapons were referred to by a variety of names none of which, however, related to espée deuz mains, or twahandswerd, both meaning the huge Renaissance two-handed sword. Instead, the weapons were referred to as simply notably large weapons as in Grans espées d'Allemagne or "big swords of Germany".

The majority of people are able to experience humour, i.e., to be amused, to laugh or smile at something funny, and thus they are considered to have a sense of humour. The hypothetical person lacking a sense of humour would likely find the behaviour induced by humour to be inexplicable, strange, or even irrational. Though ultimately decided by personal taste, the extent to which an individual will find something humorous depends upon a host of variables, including geographical location, culture, maturity, level of education, intelligence and context.

In partial heterochromia or sectoral heterochromia, part of one iris is a different color from its remainder.\n\nIn visual novels, "heterochromia" usually refers to complete heterochromia. It may occur from natural causes, but is often indicative of a supernatural characteristic.\n\nWhen using this trait, also include the traits for the individual eye colours.\n\nFor characters with [url=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heterochromia#Central_heterochromia]central heterochromia[/url], use [url=https://vndb.org/i934]Central Heterochromia[/url] instead of this trait.

Whereas justice implies actions undertaken and supported by a legitimate judicial system grounded upon a foundation of ethics and morals of the authorities, revenge implies actions undertaken by an individual or narrowly defined group outside the boundaries of judicial or ethical conduct whose goal is to force a wrongdoer to suffer the same or greater pain than that which was originally inflicted to a party.

If combs, brushes, and scissors aren’t used on the hair, the hair will tangle together as it grows, eventually resulting in the twisted, matted ropes of hair known as dreadlocks.\n\nDreadlocks are associated most closely with the Rastafari movement, but people from many groups in history before them have worn dreadlocks.

They are the descendants of youkai from long time ago who had decided to live on in the human society and thus had took human spouses. The special abilities the jinyou have are a result of their youkai blood that they had inherited from their youkai ancestors (thus the nature of the abilities are also determined by their ancestors).\n\nThe kanji for jinyou is 人妖, first one meaning "Man" and the second one meaning "Demon" (this kanji is the same as the one in 妖怪 "youkai", which is referring to the supernatural beings in Japanese and Chinese mythology and doesn't always mean "demon" literally). Putting the two kanji together, it'll roughly mean, "a human youkai".

The team with more points at the end of the game wins, but additional time (overtime) may be issued when the game ends with a tie. The ball can be advanced on the court by bouncing it while walking or running (dribbling) or passing it to a teammate.

There is usually a resonance head on the underside of the drum, typically tuned to a slightly lower pitch than the top drumhead. Other techniques have been used to cause drums to make sound, such as the thumb roll. Drums are the world's oldest and most ubiquitous musical instruments, and the basic design has remained virtually unchanged for thousands of years.\n\nDrums may be played individually, with the player using a single drum, and some drums such as the djembe are almost always played in this way. Others are normally played in a set of two or more, all played by the one player, such as bongo drums and timpani. A number of different drums together with cymbals form the basic modern drum kit.

[url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sukeban]Wikipedia[/url]\n\nThe sukeban was a truly unique subculture in Japanese society. The term 'sukeban' was created by Japanese police to categorise and explain the rise of teenage all-female street gangs in the 1960s. Meaning 'delinquent girl' or 'girl boss', the sukeban were groups of teenage girls that protested against society with their altered fashion, radical solidarity and being involved in offences such as, violence, theft and drug use. They protested against mainstream gender norms and feminine expectations in a male-dominated society. The idea of a woman 'behaving badly' went against the gender norms of how a woman is supposed to act, and provided a thrilling way to challenge society. In addition, the expectations of how a woman dressed were restricting and sexist, and the sukeban weren't going to accept this anymore and that's why they altered their look.\nThe common signifiers of sukeban fashion include:\n - long skirt opposed to mini-skirt \n - blouses were cut short to expose the waist\n - brightly dyed or permed hair \n - school shoes were replaced with Converse sneakers\n - wearing coloured socks\n - rolled up sleeves\n - weapons like chains, baseball bat or katana \n\n[url=https://s2.vndb.org/sf/69/129569.jpg]Example 1[/url]\n[url=https://s2.vndb.org/sf/68/129568.jpg]Example 2[/url]\n[url=https://vndb.org/c20349]Example 3[/url]\n[url=https://vndb.org/c30794]Example 4[/url]

Frequently bimbos employ plastic surgery to enhance their looks. Tattoos and piercing are also occasionally proudly displayed.\n\n2. Outlook: Bimbos crave hedonistic activity and frequently participate in parties and other social gatherings. They are usually sexually [url=/i1562]promiscuous[/url] and have multiple sexual partners. They might also be involved in sex work.\n\n3. Intelligence: Bimbos are usually portrayed as shallow and lacking intelligence. Contrary to this belief, some of them can be pretty smart, but lacking a desire for hard work. This results in them taking the easiest paths toward their goal.

i3549	i42	0	0	t	t	t	Bimbofication	Gyarufication\nGangurofication\nGyaruka\nギャル化	This character is subjected to bimbofication. Bimbofication is a type of [url=/i2073]Sexual Corruption[/url], which results in the character becoming a [url=/i3547]Bimbo[/url]. The character is usually initially described as innocent/prude, smart, diligent, or simply unassuming, however the circumstances align to turn them into an oversexed sexpot, usually known as a [url=/i3547]Bimbo[/url]. The usual changes experienced by the character are these:\n\n1. Looks: Character starts dressing in revealing and eye-catching clothing, wear gaudy make-up and lots of fashion accessories, dye their hair (blonde colour dominates, but other variations are possible). Frequently bimbos employ plastic surgery to enhance their looks. Tattoos and piercing are also occasionally proudly displayed.\n\n2. Outlook: The character starts craving hedonistic activities and frequently participates in parties and other social gatherings. They usually become sexually [url=/i1562]promiscuous[/url] and start having sex with multiple partners. They might even get involved in sex work.\n\n3. Intelligence: In fantasy/sci-fi settings the character usually is subjected to mental degradation that somehow decreases their intelligence. In real world setting, the character reprioritizes their lifestyle, usually dropping out of school, retiring from work, in order to seek a more hedonistic and social lifestyle. Drug use and abuse is also pretty common in such works.\n\nA particular variation of the trope present in Japan is Gyarufication (and by extension Gangurofication), where a normal high school girl (or a young woman) usually falls in with a bad crowd, and over the course of the game starts displaying looks and attitude associated with the negative [url=/i1219]Gyaru[/url] / [url=/i1054]Ganguro[/url] stereotypes. The usual bimbo tropes of changing the looks, becoming morally lax, seeking hedonistic activities and sex, and not caring about studies or work tend to apply. Their lifestyle tends to be costly and will often lead to enjo-kousai and prostitution.\n\n[i]Do NOT use this trait if the character is already a bimbo/gyaru/ganguro or they're already morally lax, corrupted at the beginning of the story.[/i]\n\nExamples of Bimbofication\n\n[url=https://s2.vndb.org/sf/02/158002.jpg]1[/url], [url=https://s2.vndb.org/sf/04/158004.jpg]2[/url], [url=https://s2.vndb.org/sf/05/158005.jpg]3[/url]\n\nExamples of Gyarufication / Gangurofication\n\n[url=https://s2.vndb.org/sf/06/158006.jpg]1[/url], [url=https://s2.vndb.org/sf/07/158007.jpg]2[/url]

Just like with other forms of Sexual Corruption, the character starts the game as pure/just/good, and is subjected to magic, mind control, rape & mindbreak, or other such techniques, that eventually make the character love/lust their corrupter and join their side.\n\nFor the trait to apply:\n1) The game must be set in a universe with clearly defined sides of Good and Evil. If story is too complex and has shades of Grey, or if the Good/Evil dichotomy is not clearly defined, then the trait should not be used.\n2) The character must change sides from non-Evil to Evil, achieved through sexual corruption perpetrated by the Evil side.
