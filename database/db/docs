d2	Adding/Editing a Visual Novel	# What can be added to the database\n\nFor a game to qualify for inclusion in the database, it must meet one of the\nfollowing two requirements:\n\n- Visual Novels that have the following characteristics:\n\n  - Choices are the only allowed (but optional) form of interactivity. There are no other gameplay elements (including stats-based gameplay in dating/raising sims). Mini-games and simple mechanics, such as map movement, are only allowed when they play a very minimal role - at least 99% of the title should be made of pure reading.\n\n  - The story is told employing one of the known Visual Novel presentation methods such as [ADV](http://s.vndb.org/sf/40/3440.jpg), [NVL](http://s.vndb.org/sf/52/3152.jpg) and their [variations](http://s.vndb.org/sf/39/339.jpg).\n\n- Visual Novel / Game hybrids that have the following characteristics:\n\n  - The game consistently uses the novel narrative for telling its story.  Examples include describing [visuals](http://s.vndb.org/sf/58/258.jpg), [events](http://s.vndb.org/sf/63/2663.jpg), [character actions](http://s.vndb.org/sf/74/274.jpg) or [thoughts](http://s.vndb.org/sf/49/449.jpg).\n    <br>This point is ESSENTIAL - dialogues, no matter how extensive, are a characteristic of such game genres as RPGs, adventure games, dating simulations, etc., NOT of visual novels.\n\n  - The story is told employing one of the known Visual Novel presentation methods such as [ADV](http://s.vndb.org/sf/40/3440.jpg), [NVL](http://s.vndb.org/sf/52/3152.jpg) and their [variations](http://s.vndb.org/sf/39/339.jpg), consistently and for a significant length - at least 50% of the game should be made of pure, VN-style reading.\n\n  - The storytelling segments should continue uninterrupted for a significant amount of time. The game should refrain from interrupting the reading and prompting the player to interact with the environment too frequently, lest the interactive elements overshadow the novel-like narrative. Depending on the presentation and the narrative techniques, some visual novels can be more prone to interrupt the narrative than others. Ultimately, if a game belongs in the database will be determined by examining the game as a whole, rather than just the sum of its parts.\n\n  - Grandfather Clause: Old school adventure games that serve as precursors to visual novels as a genre are in the database due to their historical value, and thus are exempt from some of the defining characteristics of a modern visual novel. There are already plenty of such exceptions in the database, so we do not accept further additions.\n\nSee also the [list of special games](/d15).\n\n\n# General info\n\nTitles\n: Multiple titles can be added, one for each language the visual novel has been published in. If the title is not in the Latin alphabet, add its [romanization](/d5#1) in the second field that appears.\n: The language that the VN's script has been originally authored in should be flagged as the "main title".\n: The titles must correspond to an existing release. Titles that are not attributed to a certain release should be included as aliases instead.\n: Unofficial titles from fan translation releases are permitted, but the "official title" should then be unchecked. Only a single title can be added per language. If multiple titles are available, prefer the first official title if there is one, even if a unofficial translation is released first, or fall back to the most commonly used fan translation.\n: In cases where separate translations exist for the original version of the game and its remake, use the title that corresponds to the original edition, even if it is an unofficial translation, regardless of when it was released.\n: If an official source (stores, official websites, etc.) consistently includes a romaji title alongside the main title (like in [G-senjou no Maou](v211) and [Saya no Uta](v97)), both titles should be considered as a single unit.\n: Edition clarifiers, like "remastered", "complete", "plus", "renewal", "package" and other similar ones shouldn't be considered as part of the main VN title, only as subtitles for a specific release. In other words, if only a certain edition (like a remaster or remake) has a translation or localization in any language, only the main title should be listed as a VN title. Any other clarifier or addition goes to the release entry. This usually corresponds to the first complete release or, in cases where there isn't one, the most recent partial and/or trial release.\n\nAliases\n:  Visual novels can be known under several names, use this field to add any aliases and acronyms used around the net. Official titles of releases should not be added here, as these are already listed in the releases.\n\nDescription\n: Short description of the main story.\n\nDevelopment<br>status\n: *Finished* - Used when the VN has been released as a "complete" game. The developer could still be working on future expansions and upgrades, but at least a "1.0"-like release is (or has been) available.\n: *In development* - Used for unreleased or unfinished VNs that are still awaiting a full release.\n: *Cancelled* - Used for unreleased or unfinished VNs that are unlikely to get a full release in the future. Sometimes developers state that they have halted development, but in many cases this is less clear cut. If there hasn't been any communication from the developer about the VN for over two years, it is often safe to assume it's been silently cancelled. Likewise if all official information about the game has disappeared for at least two months (i.e. official website dead, store pages gone, etc).\n\nLength\n: Very rough estimate of the time required to finish all endings of the visual novel. To determine the length of a game, it's often better to ignore this time indication and instead compare it with other games you've played. It's all relative, after all.\n: The length field should remain empty for "work in progress" visual novels with only trial/partial releases, as it's hard to judge the length of an unfinished work, and the developers are wont to overestimate the length of their games. The exception is granted when the further development of the VN is abandoned, and the trial/partial is all that has been released.\n\nExternal links\n: Links to external resources about this visual novel. To get the URLs, go to the sites ([Wikidata](https://www.wikidata.org/) or [Renai.us](http://renai.us/)), search for a page about the game, and determine the ID or name of that page to fill out in the text boxes.\n: For Renai.us links, the ID is located at the end of the url (e.g. for [Ripples](/v988) the ID is [ripples](https://renai.us/game/ripples)).\n: A [VNStat](https://vnstat.net/) link will automatically appear after 20 votes has been made or after the Wikidata ID field has been filled.\n: For Wikidata links, the ID is located at the end of the url and after the title of an entry (called items). They always start with the letter Q followed by a numeric value (e.g. for [Saya no Uta](/v97), the Wikidata ID is [Q890707](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q890707)). Once a Wikidata ID has been added, the database will automatically fetch some additional links based on the information present on that item. This process can take from a few seconds to several hours, but not more than a day. Currently, the websites added with this method are: [Wikipedia (English)](https://en.wikipedia.org/), [Wikipedia (Japanese)](https://ja.wikipedia.org/), [MobyGames](https://www.mobygames.com/), [GameFAQs](https://gamefaqs.gamespot.com/), [IGDB](https://www.igdb.com/), [IndieDB](https://www.indiedb.com/), [HowLongToBeat](https://howlongtobeat.com/), [VGMdb](https://vgmdb.net/), [Anime Characters Database (ICDB)](https://www.animecharactersdatabase.com/), [PC Gaming Wiki](https://www.pcgamingwiki.com/), [Lutris](https://lutris.net/) and [Wine AppDB](https://appdb.winehq.org/).\n: Note that the database will show all links present on a Wikidata item, making it possible to have multiple links of any website in a single entry. (e.g. 7 GameFAQs links on [STEINS;GATE](/v2002)).\n\nRelated anime\n: Some visual novels (e.g. [Clannad](/v4) and [Utawarerumono](/v3)) have anime adaptions, and some visual novels were adapted from an anime series. Use this field to specify these related anime for the visual novel.\n: Anime should be specified using [AniDB](http://anidb.net/) IDs. To add an anime, just search for it on AniDB and add the numeric ID of the entry (found in the _aid=xxx_ part of the URL) to the edit field. Multiple IDs should be separated with a whitespace.\n\n: If the visual novel already has a relation with an other visual novel, and both games have an anime adaption, the same anime does not have to be added to both games. For example, [Da Capo](/v264) has two anime adaptions ([837](http://anidb.net/a837), [2832](http://anidb.net/a2832)), and [Da Capo II](/v266) as well. ([5419](http://anidb.net/a5419), [5652](http://anidb.net/a5652)) But the relations for Da Capo II do not have to be added to Da Capo and vice versa - the internal visual novel relations will take care of that.\n\n: After submitting a new AniDB ID, VNDB will automatically fetch information about the anime and will present that on the site. This action can take a few minutes to - in the worst case - hours. In that time you will see the ID of the anime, but not the title and links to AnimeNFO and Anime News Network. It is not possible to manually add this information, this will be fetched automatically!\n\n\n# Staff & Cast\n\nIt's possible to link VN entries to [staff entries](/d16) in the staff and cast tabs.\n\nIn both tabs, staff aliases can be selected by searching for their romanized or original names. If the name is not in the database yet, you need to [add it](/d16) first.\n\n\n## Staff\n\nThe staff tab lists the people or groups involved in the creation of the visual novel. The following roles can be used:\n\n- Scenario\n- Character design\n- Composer\n- Director: Only for people involved in the game's creation. Translation or group leaders shouldn't be added as director.\n- Artist\n- Vocals: Vocals used in the music. Not to be used for voice actors of characters, these should be listed under [cast](#3.2) instead.\n- Translator\n- Editor: Any text editor who worked during the original production or a translation. Image editors should be added as "staff".\n- Quality Assurance: Any staff that worked as QA analysts, debuggers, proofreaders or testers.\n- Staff: Used for any additional minor roles, use the "notes" field to indicate the staff's involvement.\n\nA few guidelines:\n\n- Use the "notes" field to indicate the exact role if the selected role category is too broad.\n- If someone performed several jobs, add multiple entries with different major roles.\n- Do not add crowdfunders/patrons/subscribers as staff even if they are thanked in the credits.\n\n\n## Cast\n\nThe cast tab lists the voice actors for each character. This tab is only available when characters have been linked to the visual novel.\n\n\n## Editions\n\nStaff can be grouped into separate editions. You can create a new edition if someone worked on a specific release not related to the original one and for translators/localization groups or individuals. These can be set as official or unofficial and have their own language flag.\n\n**Original edition:**\n\nThe default edition present in all visual novel entries. This is where the VN's script is originally written, which means that the language of a original edition always corresponds with what language the VN's main title is. There are VNs which the first complete release is actually a translation release (e.g. [Dragonia](/v63)). In this case, always treat them as a translation release and add a new edition.\n\nIn most cases, the "original edition" represents the first complete release of a VN entry. If there isn't a complete release, use the most recent partial/trial release instead. For specific cases, refer to the following points:\n\n- For VNs with only partial releases (as it could be the case for works released in episodic format, for example [Rewrite: Oka-ken Katsudou Kiroku Gaiden](/v31425) and [Dare mo Shiranai Sora e no Namida](/v23072)), all staff who worked on any of those releases should be credited under "original edition".\n\n- For ongoing or cancelled projects, or works that have been updated over time, every staff who took part on the project should be credited under "original edition". In other words, do not create new editions for each version or compilation of any given work.\n\n- For VN entries that have multiple releases on the same date of its "original edition" (for example [Ever17](/v17)), new editions can be created for each specific releases, but the staff who worked on all of them should still be credited under "original edition".\n\n- A new edition can be created for staff who only worked on a trial version, but were not involved in the full release.\n\n- Do not create a new edition or add duplicate roles if the same staff worked on every release and had the same role in each one of them. New editions should only be created for staff who where not involved in the original edition, had a different role or worked under a different name or pseudonym.\n\n- Do not create a new edition for uncredited staff. They should go under the respective editions they worked on.\n\n**Unofficial editions:**\n\nFor database consistency, any edition should be marked as unofficial if the related release entry is also marked as unofficial.\n\nIf the same staff worked on more than one release and had the same role in all of them (as it could be the case for remasters or retranslations), only a single edition should be created for those releases.\n\nDo not add new editions for unofficial TBA releases or unreleased projects unless the author distributed a partial release. The same rule applies for the creation of staff entries.\n\n**Translations:**\n\nTranslations and localizations should have their own edition, one for each language, no matter if they were done by an individual, a group or a company. This includes translations made by the original developers or if the VN is released in multiple languages at launch or added in updates or patches.\nIf the same people were involved in several translations and had the same role in all of them, only a single edition should be created. An exception should be made if changes on staff or roles were made between translations. In those cases, every project should have their own edition and all members involved should be credited accordingly (even if there would be any duplicates).\n\nFor machine translations, a staff edition may only be created if the machine's output has been edited by a human. In that case the editor can be noted under the staff and the edition title should have the "(MTL)" suffix to be consistent with the related release entries' MTL flag.\nUnedited MTL should not have any staff credited in the database.\n\n**Edition name:**\n\nAs a standard, we decided on a formatting when making a new section for edition. The naming is divided into two categories: primary and secondary name.\n\nPrimary name\n: A short name for the edition. It should be taken from main difference between the edition in question and the original. It could be a platform, translation, release name (e.g. "[Reflection Blue](/r72180) edition" can be used for [Summer Pockets](/v20424)'s complete edition), or anything that differentiate the editions.\n\nSecondary name\n: Used to tell the difference between the edition in question and with other releases beside the original. Only add when needed.\n\nExamples of before and after adding secondary names.\n\n* Primary name: **Remake** edition, **Console** edition, **AwesomeGuy's translation**.\n* Secondary name: Remake **English** edition, Console **remake** edition, AwesomeGuy's translation **(based on remake edition)**.\n\nFor translation, always prefer "translation" as its clarifier, so the name would look like "[publisher's name]'s translation". Specific language name doesn't need to be included. If the original developer/publisher made the translation themselves, use this formatting instead: [language] edition.\n\nDon't add new section if a release is the same edition with another (i.e. no staff's role change or new staff addition). If needed, merge and rename an existing edition instead, e.g. "WorldProject & WaveSoft's translation", "Mobile, Switch, & PS4 edition". \n\nFor capitalization, use the standard English sentence capitalization rule, meaning only the first letter of the sentence, a language name, etc. should be capitalized. For producer and staff names, the original capitalization should be kept as is.  \n\n# Image\n\nEvery visual novel should have an image, preferably one of the official cover art of one of the releases. In some cases, especially with doujin games, if there is no official cover art available, a general image from the game's homepage or a screenshot of the game itself could be used instead.\n\nImages can be uploaded in JPEG or PNG format, and should not be larger than 10 MiB.  All images larger than 256x400px will automatically be resized to fit on the page.\n\nImages should be [flagged accordingly](/d19).\n\n\n# Relations\n\nVisual novel relations can be used to indicate what games are related to each other.\n\nWhen adding a relation, the reverse relation will automatically be added to the other visual novel. E.g. if you add game x as a sequel to game y, then game y will automatically be added as a prequel to game x. You do not have to edit both games.\n\nOnly specify **direct** relations. If one game 1 is listed to have a relation with game 2, and game 2 has a relation with game 3, then game 3 does not have to be added as a relation to game 1. This may sound a bit confusing at first, but you will understand when you look at the relation graphs. When editing relations, always try to think about the relations between all related games - as shown in the graph - instead of only looking at the specific visual novel you're editing.\n\nThe "official" checkbox can be used to indicate whether relation is an official one or not.  A relation is official if both games were published by the same brand, or at least the publisher of the earlier game has given permission to create the later game. In general: fandiscs and games of the same series are official, while fan fiction is not.\n\nThere is a static list of relations to choose from (as described below). As with many things, the relations between games can in reality be more complex than these options could describe. Simply choose the option you think is closest to describing the actual relation when you're not sure which one to choose.\n\nSequel\n: Continuation of the story. <=>_Prequel_.\n\nPrequel\n: The story happens before the original story.<=>_Sequel_.\n\nSame setting\n: Same universe, world, reality and timeline, but completely different characters.\n  The definition of "setting" is not always easy to define, but usually it\n  means that if places or items not existing in the real world described in one\n  game also exist in the other game, you could use this relation.\n\nAlternative version\n: Same setting, same characters, but the story is told differently.\n\nShares characters\n: Different story, but shares some characters.\n\nSide story\n: The story takes place sometime during the parent storyline. <=>_Parent story_\n\nParent story\n: Opposite of _Side story_.\n\nSame series\n: The games are part of the same series.\n\nFandisc\n: [Fandisc](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fan_disc).\n\nOriginal game\n: The opposite of fandisc.\n\n\n\n# Screenshots\n\nEach visual novel entry can have at most 10 screenshots. Screenshots can be uploaded in JPEG and PNG format. The uploaded screenshots are strictly moderated to follow the guidelines listed below. It is highly recommended to follow our [instructions on creating good screenshots](/d13) if you don't want your efforts to go to waste.\n\n- All images must be in the highest native resolution of the VN. The native resolution is the resolution for which the bitmap images are made. Any upscaling or downscaling, whether done by the game engine itself or by manually using an image editor, is **not** allowed! An exception to this rule is made for games that have no native resolution (e.g. using realtime 3D graphics instead). Moreover, for games whose native resolution exceeds 1080p, the images can be uploaded downscaled while preserving the aspect ratio (though the native resolution is still preferred, if the user has a capability to take such screenshots).\n- All images have to be screenshots of the **game itself**, this means that any window borders will have to be removed before uploading. We are neither interested in your heavily modified window borders nor in your awesome AGTH setup.\n- At least half of the images should be actual screenshots of the game. That is, they should include character sprites or some form of dialog or user interface. Plain event CG images without any text or interfaces are allowed to demonstrate the drawing style, but should not dominate over the other screenshots.\n- Uploading screenshots with erotic content is allowed, as long as the ratio of erotic/non-erotic screenshots is somewhat in line with the actual erotic/non-erotic ratio of the VN itself. For example, if a 10 hour VN has only 2 H-scenes of 10 minutes, it wouldn't be appropriate to upload more than 2 or 3 erotic images. On the other hand, if a VN is mostly about sex, it wouldn't make sense to upload only one erotic screenshot. It is advised - even for the sex-only games - to have at least one non-erotic screenshot.\n- Keep the spoilers to a minimum. It's impossible to upload screenshots that are completely devoid of spoilers, but it is possible to keep this to a minimum. I.e. screenshots early in the beginning of the VN are preferred, and shots later in the game are fine as long as they don't reveal any major information about the plot.\n- Images should [flagged accordingly](/d19).\n- Screenshots have to be unmarked: they shouldn't contain any copyright information, website URL, or other text that's not present in the original screenshot. Some consoles or engines may automatically add a copyright marker to screenshots, only in these cases is it acceptable to upload screenshots with a copyright marker.\n- Screenshots should preferably be of the English or original (Japanese) releases. Other languages are allowed, but the number of images should be kept to a minimum.\n- Do not post different language versions of the same screenshot, this is not a comparison gallery.
d3	Adding/Editing a Release	# When to add a release\n\nA 'release' is a product - either physical or digital - containing (parts of) the visual novel. This excludes soundtracks, drama CDs, fandisks, and other products that do not contain the visual novel itself.\n\nAll releases should be added separately. For example, a limited, regular and download edition shouldn't be combined into one release, even if they share the release date and contents. For games sold in physical format, separate releases can be distinguished by their JAN/UPC/EAN number.\n\nMajor updates should be added as a new release instead of editing the existing one. What can be considered a "major update" is a bit subjective, but some changes that require a new entry are mostly new platforms and new languages. Other updates can be added in the notes field, but the release date should remain unchanged.\n\nFor compilations and bundles where some information differs for each included visual novel, such as compilations containing games from different developers or having different animations, engine, etc. leave those fields empty or mark them as "unknown" as appropriate. In some rare cases, for example if the information between those VNs is vastly different or if affects many different fields, it may be better to split those releases into different entries.\n\n# General info\n\nLanguage\n: What language is this release? Use the language that the majority of the game is in. \n\nMachine Translation\n: Should be checked if automated programs, such as AI tools, were used to implement support for this language, either partially or fully. Should be checked even if the translation has been edited by a human. Should NOT be checked if the translation was entirely done by humans, even when its quality happens to be worse than machine translation. Translations based on another machine translation are also considered MTL, even if automated programs haven't been used.\n\nTitle\n: Once a language has been selected, the title field will appear. Multiple titles can be added, one for each language the release has been published in. If the title is not in the Latin alphabet, add its [romanization](/d5#1) in the second field that appears.\n: For any title present in the main VN entry, the field in releases entries will be automatically filled with that information whenever a new language is added. If the field is left empty, it defaults to the same name as the main title.\n: If the release includes the language that the VN's script has been originally authored in, that language should be flagged as the "main title". Otherwise, if multiple languages are available, the publisher's primary language should be preferred.\n\nOfficial\n: Use this checkbox to indicate if the release is official (made or sanctioned by the original developer) or unofficial. Note that this official flag is in relation to the visual novel that the release is linked to, so even if the VN is an unofficial fanfic in some franchise, the release itself can still be official.\n\nPatch\n: Use this checkbox to indicate that the release is a (translation) patch, used to patch an other release.\n\nFreeware\n: Check if this box if the game is downloadable (or otherwise distributed) at no cost.\n\nContains erotic scenes\n: <br>Not all 18+ titles have erotic content and not all sub-18+ titles are free of it, hence the presence of a checkmark which signals that the game contains erotic content. See [below](#2.1) for what constitutes erotic content.\n\nAge rating\n: The minimum official age rating for the release. On most releases, this is specified on the packaging or on product web pages. For indie or doujin projects, this is usually a recommended age stated by a developer or publisher.\n\nRelease date\n: For commercial games, the sale date. For all others, the date on which the release was first available. If it was posted on a website, the date on which the post was public.\n\nNotes\n: Anything miscellaneous and useful.  Generally, extras, progress information and other useful links go here. If dates are being added in this field, use the standard ISO format (YYYY-MM-DD : Year-Month-Day).\n\n\n## Erotic content\n\n**Considered to be erotic scenes**\n\n- Actual explicit sex scenes (whether they are optically censored or not).<br>\n  NSFW examples: [Censored](https://s2.vndb.org/sf/31/23831.jpg), [Uncensored](https://s2.vndb.org/sf/33/88433.jpg).\n- Implicit sex scenes (scenes where the genitals are strategically covered, but it's clear to us the characters are having sex)<br>\n  Examples:<br>\n  [Genitals covered by a character position](https://s2.vndb.org/sf/27/162327.jpg)<br>\n  [Genitals covered by objects](https://s2.vndb.org/sf/65/157465.jpg)\n- Detailed text-only sex scenes<br>\n  [Example](https://s2.vndb.org/sf/07/95907.jpg)\n- Presence of detailed genitals or genitals covered by clearly visible optical censorship without the presence of sex scenes<br>\n  [Example](https://s2.vndb.org/sf/28/162328.jpg)\n\n**Not considered to be erotic scenes**\n\n- Nudity without sex, where the character genitals are censored by covering them with light beams, the characters are posing strategically to hide the genitals, or they are covered with objects<br>\n  [Example 1](https://s2.vndb.org/sf/29/162329.jpg)<br>\n  [Example 2](https://s2.vndb.org/sf/30/162330.jpg)<br>\n  [Example 3](https://s2.vndb.org/sf/56/95056.jpg)\n\n- Bare breasts in the absence of actual sex scenes<br>\n  [NSFW example](https://s2.vndb.org/sf/37/109737.jpg)\n\n- Full nudity, where the genitals are poorly detailed or completely absent ("Barbie Doll anatomy"), in the absence of actual sex scenes. Examples:<br>\n  [Poorly defined genitals](https://s2.vndb.org/sf/83/10283.jpg)<br>\n  [Barbie Doll anatomy](https://s2.vndb.org/sf/43/109743.jpg)\n\n\n# Format\n\nPlatform\n: The platforms that the product was released for. Does not include emulated platforms (e.g. Playstation 2 games on Playstation 3) or WINE. "DVD Player" and "Blue-Ray Player" refers to games playable as a normal DVD Video (DVDPG) or Blue-ray Video (BD PG or Blu-ray Game) and should not be confused with the DVD or Blue-Ray as a medium.\n\nEngine\n: The game engine used for this release. A predefined list of common engines is available but if the used engine is not listed, it is possible to select _Other_ and fill out a different engine name. Please only provide the name of the engine, not its version. When providing an engine that is not in the list, please first [check the database](/r/engines) for other releases with the same engine, so that all releases use a consistent name for that engine.\n\nResolution\n: Primary/native screen resolution of the game.\n\nVoiced\n: Indicates whether this release includes voice acting in the VN/ADV parts of the game.  _Fully voiced_ indicates that all characters (usually excluding the protagonist and some minor characters) are voiced in all scenes. _Only ero scenes voiced_ speaks for itself, and _Partially voiced_ should be used when there is some voice acting, but only for the main characters or only in some scenes.\n\nCensoring\n: Whether erotic graphics are censored with mosaic or other optical censoring. If the release contains erotic content but doesn't have erotic graphics, leave this as unknown.\n\n## Media\n\nCD\n: CD-ROM, typically 700MB.\n\nDVD\n: DVD5, typically 4.5GB, or DVD9, typically 9GB. DVDPG games are DVD.\n\nGD-ROM\n: Dreamcast games are normally GD disks.\n\nBlu-ray\n: Blu-ray Disk, typically 30-60GB+. Requires a Blu-ray Drive. Playstation 3, Playstation 4 and Playstation 5 are normally Blu-ray.\n\nFloppy\n: 5 1/4" or 3 3/4", no greater than 1.44MB.\n\nCassette tape\n: Any magnetic tapes cartridge (also called "cartridge tape") and magnetic tape cassettes. Commonly used by early models of personal computers (IBM, Commodore, Apple II, ZX spectrum, among many others). \n\nCartridge\n: Compare with Memory Cards (below). Read-only. Famicom (NES), Super Nintendo (SNES), Game Boy Advanced (GBA), Nintendo DS and 3DS, Playstation Vita and Nintendo Switch use cartridges.\n\nMemory Card\n: Any SD (Secure Digital) Card variant or MMC variant, Compact Flash or "USB Sticks". The Main difference between this and Cartridge (above) is that Memory Cards are re-writable (RW).\n\nUMD\n: Universal Media Disk, typically 2.2GB. Playstation Portable uses this format.\n\nNintendo Optical Disk\n: Non-CD or DVD optical disks used by various Nintendo consoles.\n\nInternet Download\n: Anything without a physical box, i.e. obtained by downloading it over a network. Includes all browser games played through a website.\n\nDownload Card\n: A package or card containing a serial code or URL that can be used to download the game from the internet.\n\nOther\n: Any format not considered to be any of these mentioned should take this media. However, it should not be used liberally and it's inclusion may need to be justified, usually in the notes field.\n\n## Animation\n\nEffects such as zooming, shaking and sprite translations are not to be considered animation. Same with lip sync and eyes blinking as it is handled in the last section.\nAnimation must appear in the reading sections of the game, gameplay sections (if they exist), main title, options menu, UI, and [Character Profiles](/g1889) are not to be considered.\n\nAnimation can be indicated in five separate sections, based on the types of content (story scenes or erotic scenes, the latter is only available if the release has been marked as containing erotic scenes) and the medium in which the animation appears. There are three media:\n\nCharacter sprites\n:   A character sprite is a cutout character presented on the foreground of either a background CG (BCG) (in which it is not embedded), or more rarely, nothing. It can come with a "sub background" e.g. furniture, but the whole is independent from the background CG. When in doubt, extracting the game assets can help in determining if a certain image is a CG or a background with a sprite.\n\n:   For the purpose of flagging animations, the character [Side Portraits](/g737) some VNs display at the side of the textbox should be treated the same as character sprites, even if no traditional character sprites appear in the game.\n\n:   It can happen that a character sprite, while being on the foreground, is embedded in the background by having their feet on the floor while matching the perspective, but either the same sprite is used in a different BCG or the BCG replaces it with different ones.\n\n:   If the character sprite animation consists solely of lip and/or eye movements while the rest of the body/face remains static, then this section should be marked as "No animation" and the \n"Character lip movement and/or eye blink" checkbox (below) should be checked instead.\n\n: Character sprites in erotic scenes must match the guidelines on [erotic content](https://vndb.org/d3#2.1) to exist.\n\nCGs\n:   CG are illustrations which cannot be decomposed into character sprites (as defined above) and BCG.\n\n:   They can take up the whole screen ([Cross†Channel](https://s2.vndb.org/sf/15/915.jpg)), some part of it ([Grisaia no Kajitsu](https://s2.vndb.org/sf/23/127123.jpg)), or overlap another CG ([Kemomimi Harem Vacation](https://s2.vndb.org/sf/25/117525.jpg)).\n\n:   Example from [Katie's Corruption](/v21017): observe the difference between [character sprites on a BG](https://s2.vndb.org/sf/85/120985.jpg) versus [a CG with characters embedded into it](https://s2.vndb.org/sf/88/120988.jpg).\n\n:   In the case where animation is involved, each frame must be separately considered CG.\n\nCutscenes\n:   A cutscene is a non interactive animated sequence that breaks the continuity of the game.\n\n:   Breaking the continuity means interrupting the flow of the scenes in a significant way. This means that if a game is entirely animated, even if you consistently lose control of the animation, it will not be considered a cutscene. Think of cutscenes as isolated non interactive animated sequences that pop up suddenly.\n\n:   Keep in mind that opening/ending videos should not be considered cutscenes, nor are [Interactive Movies](/g1487) or releases with "locked automode" if they have any kind of text presentation (like [DVD Player](/r?f=4odvd) and [Blue-ray Player](/r?f=4obdp) releases, among others) unless they have well delimited scenes that interrupt the regular text-based storytelling.\n\n:   Example of games featuring cutscenes are\n\n:   - [Katawa Shoujo](/v945) (cinematics)\n    - [Robotics;Notes](/v5883) (Kill Balad victory/defeat)\n    - [428 ~Fuusa Sareta Shibuya de~](/v1299) (movies)\n    - [Marco to Ginga Ryuu](/v26902) (minutes long anime)\n\nFor each section, you can indicate whether the content and medium exists and whether they are animated. If a section is animated, you can select the type(s) of animation being employed and its frequency. Available animation types are:\n\nHand drawn\n:   Also known as frame-by-frame, 2D animation, traditional animation or cel animation. Every frame of animation is drawn independently of each other (typically, of course, only the part of the frame that is animated is redrawn). You can see this type of animation being used by most 2D anime.\n\n:   Visual novels that use pixel art sprites and are animated by hand are also included in this category.\n\n:   Big hint: if the animation doesn't use [Flat Tints Only](/g3212), it has a good chance of not being hand drawn but vectorial animation. Hand drawn animation is relatively rare in visual novels.\n\n:   Examples:\n\n:   - [Hand drawn cutscene](https://s.vndb.org/u/handdrawn-cutscene-katawashoujo.mp4) (from [Katawa Shoujo](/v945))\n    - [Hand drawn CG](https://s.vndb.org/u/handdrawn-cg-viperv8.mp4) (from [Viper-V8](/v8327), the Viper series in general has lots of hand drawn animation)\n    - [Hand drawn pixel art sprite sample](https://s.vndb.org/u/handdrawn-sprite-airpressure.mp4) (from [Air Pressure](/v4118))\n    - [Hand drawn pixel art CG sample](https://s.vndb.org/u/handdrawn-cg-deep.mp4) (from [is it that deep, bro?](/v28613))\n    - [Hand drawn CG (NSFW)](https://s.vndb.org/u/handdrawn-cg-maou.mp4) (from [G-senjou no Maou](/v211))\n    - [Sisters ~Natsu no Saigo no Hi~](/v3896)\n    - [Qualiaffordance](/v5397)\n    - Most 2D anime\n\nVectorial\n:   Vectorial animation is made animating a pre-existing illustration using various post-processing techniques, often with the help of software such as E-mote, Live2D or Adobe After Effects. The illustration is manipulated in various ways to simulate movement, such as deforming and/or stretching parts, cutting and moving around other parts, etc.\n\n:   One thing that gives away vectorial animation is that the movement is not natural and the illustration stretched. It may give a 3D feels even though the original illustration is in 2D.\n\n:   If software is used to generate a complete 3D model out of a 2D illustration, flag the animation as 3D instead.\n\n:   Examples:\n\n:   - You can see plenty of examples of vectorial character sprites on the [official website of E-mote](https://emote.mtwo.co.jp/about/). At the bottom of the page, you can see how such movements are created with the use of a software and never without drawing new illustrations, only through manipulation. See also the [Highly Animated Sprites](/g2038) tag.\n    - [Vectorial sprite](https://s.vndb.org/u/vectorial-sprite-death.mp4) (from [Death. Love, Me](/v32704))\n    - [Vectorial CG (violent)](https://s.vndb.org/u/vectorial-cg-letter.mp4) (from [The Letter](/v18550))\n    - [Vectorial sprite (NSFW)](https://s.vndb.org/u/vectorial-sprite-namaiki.mp4) (from [Namaiki Imouto o Choukyou Shitatta](/v31621))\n    - [Vectorial CG (NSFW)](https://s.vndb.org/u/vectorial-cg-love3.mp4) (from [LOVE³ -Love Cube-](/v21676))\n    - [Vectorial CG (NSFW)](https://s.vndb.org/u/vectorial-cg-sukisuki.mp4) (from [Watashi ga Suki nara "Suki" tte Itte!](/v17376))\n\n3D\n:   Animation using computer-rendered 3D models. Some 3D animations apply post-processing to make it appear in the same style as hand drawn animation (e.g. by using cell shading), but these should still be flagged as 3D.\n\n:   Examples:\n\n:   - [3D sprites](https://s.vndb.org/u/3d-sprite-mahou.mp4) (from [Mahou Shoujo Project](/v32199))\n    - [3D CG](https://s.vndb.org/u/3d-cg-kingdoms.mp4) (from [Corrupted Kingdoms](/v26469))\n    - [3D CG (suggestive)](https://s.vndb.org/u/3d-cg-aidroid.mp4) (from [Custom Aidroid Ai](/v7979))\n    - [3D cutscene (NSFW)](https://s.vndb.org/u/3d-cutscene-wolf.mp4) (from [Ookami Shoujo to Issho](/v20378))\n\nLive action\n:   This type of animation uses video recordings featuring real actors or real-life scenery.\n\n:   Examples:\n\n:   - [Live action cutscene](https://s.vndb.org/u/live-cutscene-renpy.mp4) (from the [Ren'py](https://www.renpy.org/) tutorial)\n    - [Live action cutscene](https://s.vndb.org/u/live-cutscene-shibuya.mp4) (from [428 ~Fuusa Sareta Shibuya de~](/v1299))\n    - [Live action CG (NSFW)](https://s.vndb.org/u/live-cg-undercontrol.mp4) (from [Under Control 2](/v33927))\n    - [Live action cutscene (NSFW)](https://s.vndb.org/u/live-cutscene-coercion.mp4) (from [Coercion](/v21477))\n\n\n**Character lip movement and/or eye blink:** This checkbox should be set if character sprites have lip and/or eye movement. Any kind of lip movement should be counted, with no bearing if the animation is in sync with all, some or none of the given text lines or voices. If characters have more animation than just lip and/or eye movement, then both this checkbox should be set and the character animation section should be filled out.\n\n**Background effects:** A background is a picture representing the surroundings, the scenery, the context. It doesn't take part in the story's action. It can be made of several parts animated separately to give an illusion of relief, depth. Most of the time, character sprites are put in front of them. Backgrounds are independent from CG and character sprites and can have their own animation, the background effects option is here to cover such cases. Examples:\n\n- [Falling snow](https://s.vndb.org/u/bg-maou.mp4) (from [G-senjou no Maou](/v211))\n- [Rain and fog](https://s.vndb.org/u/bg-letter.mp4) (from [The Letter](/v18550))\n- [Waves](https://s.vndb.org/u/bg-chrono.mp4) (from [Chrono Clock](/v16208))\n- [Train movement](https://s.vndb.org/u/bg-yesterday.mp4) (from [Yesterday, the World Ended](/v32273))\n- [Particles and fire effect](https://s.vndb.org/u/bg-hearts.mp4) (from [Hearts Astride](/v31829))\n- [Particles and movement](https://s.vndb.org/u/bg-warrior.mp4) (from [Magical Meow-Meow Warrior?!](/v32112))\n- [More background effects](https://s.vndb.org/u/bg-infinite.mp4) (from [(In)finite Girl](/v32052))\n\nIf the visual novel is composed entirely of CGs (as is common for 3DCG games), **Character lip movement and/or eye blink** and **Background effects** should be set to "Unknown or N/A". In case the CG characters have facial animation, treat those as CG animations instead.\n\n\n## DRM\n\nSome releases have DRM (Digital Rights Management or, more accurately, Restrictions Management) in order to combat piracy and restrict copying. If a release does not have any form DRM, the "DRM-free" option should be added. If a release does have DRM, the specific implementation of DRM should be added.\n\nDRM should not be applied to soundtracks, drama CDs, fandisks, and other products that do not contain the visual novel itself. These can be mentioned in the release notes.\n\nFor digital releases it is common that different online shops have different types of DRM for the same release. In these cases, each type of DRM should be added and the notes field should indicate to which shop(s) that DRM applies.\n\nWhen a particular DRM implementation is not already available in the list, a new one may be added. The following fields should then be filled out:\n\nDisc check\n:  The CD/DVD/media must be inserted into the computer for the game to start.\n\nCD-key\n:  A serial number or code must be input during installation from the game media. This code is typically found on the packaging or the manual.\n\nOnline activation\n:  An internet connection is required during installation in order to activate the game.\n\nActivation limit\n:  Typically used with online activation. The game can only be installed a limited number of times, or be installed on a limited number of devices at a time.\n\nAccount-based\n:  An online account is required in order to install or run the game.\n\nAlways online\n:  An active internet connection is required in order play this game, not just during installation.\n\nCloud gaming\n:  The game assets are streamed over the internet instead of being stored locally on the player's computer. Implies "Always online".\n\nPhysical\n:  The game comes with a physical item that you need to keep around in order to run or advance the game. This is only rarely used for old retro games.\n\nDescription\n:  Short description of the DRM implementation, can be used to describe its origin, how it is commonly applied and, when available, link to an official support page describing how to use it.\n\n(The DRM properties are based on [PCGamingWiki](https://www.pcgamingwiki.com/wiki/Digital_rights_management_(DRM)))\n\nIf the same DRM software is used with different properties in different releases, a new DRM implementation should be added for each set of properties.\n\nIf the exact implementation of the DRM is unknown but its effect is known, one of the "(generic)" DRM options can be chosen instead, e.g. [CD-key (generic)](/r/drm?s=CD-key+(generic)).\n\nIf a DRM implementation has been phased out and an official patch has been made available to disable the DRM, then the release should be updated to have both the original DRM and the "DRM-free" type with a patch link in the notes. For digital releases, the entry should always reflect the latest DRM state.\n\nAfter a new DRM implementation has been added through the release form, it can only be edited or updated by a moderator. Corrections can be suggested on the forums.\n\nThe following are *not* considered DRM:\n\n- Restrictions for accessing a store or website.\n- Restrictions for buying and/or acquiring a title or files.\n- Browser games that don't require extra steps to play besides an internet connection.\n- Microtransactions or monetization schemes.\n\n\n\n# External identifiers & links\n\nJAN/UPC/EAN\n: The [GTIN](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_Trade_Item_Number) code of the product. Often called "JAN" for Japanese releases, "UPC" for USA and Canada and "EAN" for Europe. The system will automatically detect the type from the code and use the appropriate term on the release page.\n: This field is also used to automatically add a link to [Play-Asia](https://www.play-asia.com/) if the release is available there. This process may take a few hours.\n\nCatalog number\n: Catalog number as assigned by the producer. Often used to identify releases on webshops, and can usually be found somewhere on the packaging of the product.\n\nOfficial website\n: URL of the official homepage for this product. Note that, even though VNDB does not support piracy, it is allowed to link to a homepage or forum that does in the case it is the only **official** source of information for this release. If this website existed but it's not available anymore, an archived link can be used instead.\n\nExternal links\n: URL of webshops and other sites that can be added besides the official website. A list of recognized sites is available in the edit form.\n\n\n# Database relations\n\n## Visual novels\n\nThe visual novels that this release (either partially or fully) covers.\n\nHow much is covered can be indicated in the type dropdown:\n\n- 'Complete' means that the release includes the full visual novel (potentially excluding bonus content or expansions that have been added in later releases).<br>\n- 'Partial' releases have most of the game, but there are things still waiting to be released.<br>\n- 'Trial' versions are heavily cut down and free releases so that you can experience a game before you buy it. Sometimes, trial versions are cut down for web transmission and do not completely represent the finished product.<br>\n\nIn the case of a translation patch, the type should indicate whether it translates the full game (Complete), or just parts of it (Partial).\n\nNotable points:\n\n- A release refers to the global status of the visual novel, so as a 'partial' release only has a part of the content, a full translation of a partial release would also be marked as a 'partial' for the same reason.<br>\n- The type of an existing release should represent the existing status, and not a predicted future one. Hence an existing partial build would be marked as 'partial' even if there is an announced future complete release. The status should be changed once the release actually happens. This is typical for fan-translations and incremental cumulative game releases on crowdfunding platforms.\n\n## DLCs\n\nDLC (Downloadable Content) is a game addon that requires the presence of the base game in order to install and play.\n\nSome DLCs add new content to the existing story (e.g. new routes, post-game epilogues, etc.), while others are self-contained separate stories.\n\n- All DLCs should be marked as patches, as they require the base game to play them. Software that is erroneously labeled as DLC by the publisher, but does not require the base game to play shouldn't be treated as a DLC but rather as a normal release entry.\n- The DLCs that add content to the existing game should be put as releases under that game's VN entry and should be labeled 'partial'.<br>\n- The DLCs that are self-contained stories should have their own VN entries instead and should be labeled 'complete'.<br>\n- Uncensored patches should not be treated as DLCs, despite sometimes being labeled as such by the publisher. They should be put under the main VN entry and be labeled 'complete' if they restore all of the censored content, and 'partial' if only part of the censored content has been restored.\n\n## Producers\n\nThe companies/groups/individuals involved in the development or publishing of this release. Does not include distributors. The following roles can be selected:\n\nDeveloper\n: The producer involved in the creation of the game itself, not necessarily of this specific release. Keep in mind that producers that have made modifications to a game but have not made the game itself should NOT be listed as developers.\n\nPublisher\n: The producer responsible for publishing this specific release. The publisher may have made modifications to the game (e.g. translating all text or porting to a different platform), but was not involved in the creation process.\n\nBoth\n: When the release is developed and published by the same producer. This is often true for doujin games and the first releases of commercial games.\n\n# Images\n\nGeneral rules:\n\n- Images must be uploaded in the highest possible quality. At the very minimum the characters, text and logo must be clearly visible or readable. Low quality images will be removed.\n- Images must not contain copyright marks, watermarks or any other kind of digital imprint, unless that is also present on the printed material.\n- Only upload official images. Fan-art or unofficial images are strongly discouraged. Official patches, DLC and translations can also have their own covers.\n- More than one cover for a single release is allowed if:\n  - The release is distributed in multiple physical packages.\n  - There are different covers available for several languages. In this case, the language field should be filled accordingly.\n  - There are alternate or exclusive covers for a single release.\n  - Different promotional covers are available. For example: different covers between digital stores.\n\n## Package covers (front and back):\n\nPackage covers must accurately represent the physical package artwork, including any markings such as age rating, compatible systems, company logo, etc, when those were printed on the package. Package art that has been cleaned up of such markings are considered "Digital promo art" instead.\n\nEach physical release has its own cover. This means a single image marked as "Package cover (front)" or "Package cover (back)" should not be used in more than one release. However these same images can be used as "package contents" for other releases if the same package is included in a bundle or special edition.\n\nScans and official images are always preferred over photographs. If a photo is used, the image must follow the following rules:\n\n- Images must not contain borders or background of any kind. A white background is only allowed for package contents and media.\n- Always remember to crop the picture so there is no background or furniture shown. If part of the cover is cropped because of this, it's very likely it's not in the correct angle and should not be uploaded.\n- Covers need to be aligned as straight as possible.\n- Small light reflections are allowed as long as it takes a very small portion of the image and keeps any text legible.\n- Images with other reflections, no matter how small, like hands or the camera, are not allowed.\n- Photos of the front or back case or box are allowed, but a picture of the cover alone is always preferred.\n- Photo manipulation is allowed to improve quality as long the image still accurately represents the package artwork.\n- Cover images must not contain stickers, bar codes, price tags or any other stuff added by a store or distributor that are not part of the original cover itself.\n\n## Package contents and media\n\n- A single image may have more than one or all additional contents, but it's preferred if each content is added separately.\n- For collectables, like figures or trading cards, a single image that shows all included content is preferred.\n- Images of CD, DVD, etc. cases with their contents inside or package cover are allowed.\n- Empty cases are not allowed unless they are decorated with a unique official artwork.\n- For manuals, magazines, art books, etc. only the cover is allowed; images of any page are not, unless it's an official image.\n- If the image includes CD keys, download codes or other identifiers that are unique to that particular product, these codes must be cencored with a white bar.\n- Do not add products that are never distributed with the release or which are sold separately.\n\nOfficial images are always preferred over photographs. If a photo is used, the image must follow the following rules:\n- For items that are not covers, all images must have at the very least a plain background. However, images with pure white background is preferable.\n- If each content is added separately, they need be aligned as straight as possible.\n- Small light reflections from the product(s) is allowed as long as it takes a very small portion of the image and does not make the text illegible and all character features are visible.\n- Images with other reflections, no matter how small it is, like hands or the camera, is not allowed.\n- Images of any product inside their cases, packages, etc. are allowed, but a picture of the contents or covers alone is preferred.\n- Images must not contain stickers, bar codes, price tags or any other stuff added by a store or distributor that are not part of the original product.\n\n## Digital promo art\n\nThis includes art that is used as header image or as the "cover" on the official website and any storefronts.\n\n- Images must not be edited in any way. This includes upscaling and downscaling.\n- Images must not have a border.\n- For visual novels in development, only the cover promoting the latest public version should be used.\n- Only add full images. Cropped images or images from small icons (like the ones from mobile stores) are not allowed.\n- Although logos or artwork alone are allowed, these should be used only when there is not an official promotional art that is a logo+artwork.\n- For visual novels with only partial releases, only add the cover related to each individual release. Do not use promotional images of the whole game unless there's a complete release for that VN. Do not add a cover for partial releases that don't have official promotional art.\n- The same image can be used for superseded releases or releases that have been updated without a new cover.\n- In some rare cases, the same image can also be used for different editions, like censored and uncensored editions, but these cases should be the exception, not the norm, and only if the VN is being actively promoted with the same image for those editions. If it's not clear or if unsure that this is the case, do not add the same cover to more than one release.\n- If there's more than one promotional art with minor differences, like logo position, cropped images, etc. only a single image should be used.
d4	Adding/Editing a Producer	# When to add a producer\n\nA producer entry may be created in one of the following scenarios:\n\n1. When it is needed to link the developer or publisher to a release entry.  In this case, the producer is required to have released at least one completed product.  This means that translation projects and starting developers may only be added when they've actually finished a project.\n2. When it is needed to link two or more producer entries together to provide a correct view of the relations between producers. The producer entries that are being linked together should qualify for the first criteria, and need to be linked to at least one release entry.\n\nProducer entries that do not qualify for either rule may be deleted after a while.\n\n\n# General info\n\nType\n: The type of producer.\n\nName (original)\n: The name of the producer in its original script.\n\nName (latin)\n: Only available if the original name is not already in the Latin script. Romanize according to our [guidelines](/d5#1).\n\nAliases\n: Other names the producer is known as. Multiple aliases should be separated by a newline.\n\nPrimary language\n: The language the the producer works in most of the time. By default, it is Japanese.\n\nWebsite\n: Official homepage of the producer.\n\nDescription\n: A history of the producer, or a description of what type of games they make.\n \nAdditional links\n: A [VNStat](https://vnstat.net/) link will automatically appear after the creation of a producer entry.\n: Currently, the only field that can be manually added as external link is Wikidata ID. To get the URLs, locate the ID at the end of the url or after the title of an entry (called items). They always start with the letter Q followed by a numeric value (e.g. for [CAPCOM Co., Ltd.](/p350), the Wikidata ID is [Q14428](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q14428)). Once a Wikidata ID has been added, the database will automatically fetch some additional links based on the information present on that website. This process can take from a few seconds to several hours, but not more than a day.\n: Currently, the websites added with this method are: [Wikipedia (English)](https://en.wikipedia.org/), [Wikipedia (Japanese)](https://ja.wikipedia.org/), [Twitter](https://twitter.com/), [MobyGames](https://www.mobygames.com/), [GameFAQs](https://gamefaqs.gamespot.com/), [SoundCloud](https://soundcloud.com/) and [Doujinshi.org](https://www.doujinshi.org/).\n: Note that the database will show all twitter usernames present on a Wikidata item, making it possible to have multiple twitter links in a single entry.\n\n\n\n# Relations\n\nThese relations provide information about which producers are related to each other, and how they are related. Choosing the correct relation may be a bit confusing, check the relation graph of the producer entry in case of doubt.  The following relations are defined:\n\nFormerly\n: The current producer was earlier known as the selected producer. This can be because of a name change, or when the earlier producer disbanded and the same people started again under a different name.\n\nSucceeded by\n: Reverse of _Formerly_ - selected producer was formerly known as the current producer.\n\nSubsidiary\n: Selected producer is a [subsidiary](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subsidiary) of the current producer.\n\nParent producer\n: Reverse of _Subsidiary_ - current producer is a subsidiary of the selected producer.\n\nImprint\n: Selected producer is an imprint of the current producer. Simply put, an "imprint" is a different name for the same group of people, used when publishing games. See [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imprint_(trade_name)) for more info.\n\nParent brand\n: Reverse of _Imprint_ - current producer is an imprint of the selected producer.\n\nSpawned\n: The selected producer was formed by former members of the current producers.  The difference with the _Formerly_ relation is that the producer where the members came from is still alive.\n\nOriginated from\n: Reverse of _Spawned_ - selected producer spawned the current producer.
d5	Editing guidelines	# Romanization\n\nThe main audience of VNDB are the English speaking fans of visual novels. In creating the database, we assume the intended audience can't read or recognise anything not written in the roman script. Therefore, romanization is applied to many fields in the database: The main title of visual novels, releases, producers and characters should all be properly romanized if they aren't in roman script already.\n\nTo keep the database consistent, we have decided to use a mix of [Hepburn](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepburn_romanization) and [Wapuro](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wapuro) for all fields. This is mostly consistent with [AniDB's romanization](http://wiki.anidb.net/w/Romanisation).\n\nFor English (or other foreign) words in a non-roman script, the original word should be used as long as it is the intended effect. If those words are in a non-roman script, a suitable romanisation technique should be used.  \n\n\n# (placeholder)\n\n(This section has been superseded by the [Image Flagging](/d19) page and this placeholder only exists to keep the section numbering)\n\n\n# Name Order\n\nIn most English speaking countries, names are given in a "given name, family name" order.  This is called "Western Order".  In English, you call someone using their given name if you know them well, otherwise use their title and family name.\n\nIn Japanese (and some other languages too), names are given in "family name, given name" order.  We call this "Japanese Order".  In Japanese you can call someone using either name with an appropriate suffix. To aid English speakers, some resources (e.g. Wikipedia) use Japanese names in Western order.  Here on vndb.org, we prefer to use the order that the original game used. That is, if it was originally a Japanese game with Japanese character names, use Japanese order. If the game is originally English, or a character has a completely foreign name (Mary Smith), use Western order.\n \n\n\n# Edit Summaries\n\nEvery edit to any page has a required "Edit summary" box, this allows you to explain yourself on what your edit is about without cluttering the main page.  You can say why you've modified the description, changed a link, or show where you obtained some information (so that other contributors can verify it).  Perhaps you want to add a visual novel to the database but are unable to find more information for it.  If you say so here, another contributor is bound to finish it off.\n\n\n\n# Descriptions From External Sources\n\nIt is possible to add a description or notes to visual novel, producer, release and character entries in the database. While original descriptions are preferred, using descriptions from external resources is allowed, provided the source is properly credited. The preferred form to credit external resources is by adding the following template to the bottom of the description:\n\n[From [url=**URL**]**title or author**[/url]]\n\nThis would result in, for example, '[From [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/Wiki/Ever17)]' for descriptions taken from Wikipedia. If the description is not literally taken from the source but has some modifications, the 'From' should be replaced with something similar, indicating that it's modified, e.g. 'Edited from', 'Based on'.\n\nAs it is not allowed to provide links to websites providing or promoting illegal downloads, the URL part should be left out for such descriptions.
d6	Frequently Asked Questions	# What is a Visual Novel?\n\nA visual novel can be seen as a combination of a novel and a computer game: they're computer games with a large text based storyline and only little interaction of the player. A typical visual novel consists of text over an anime-style background image and is accompanied by background music.  Throughout the game, the player usually has to answer a few questions which will have an effect on the story, thus playing a visual novel a second time while giving other answers may result in an entirely different plot.\n\nTo get a general idea of the genre, try one of the free short visual novels from [al|together](http://altogether.insani.org/).\n\n\n# How about Eroge, H-Games and Dating Sims?\n\nAn eroge or H-game is basically any Japanese game that features sexual content. Many visual novels are eroge and many eroge are visual novels, but this is not a rule. The definition of dating sim is a bit more vague, but it's usually the same as a visual novel, except that a dating sim generally uses a gameplay based on statistics.\n\nThere are no strict bounds to the definition of "visual novel", most eroge and dating sims include elements of visual novels, but may - strictly speaking - not be visual novels themselves. VNDB has its own rules for inclusion in the database, see the [guidelines](/d2) and the [list of special games](/d15) for more information.\n\n\n# Why a Visual Novel Database?\n\nThe internet is large, very large, but the number of English resources related to visual novels is only very limited. VNDB attempts to collect and present as much information as possible that would otherwise be very hard to find for the English speaking audience. This way fans can easily keep track of new releases and localizations of their favorite games, while not having to browse numerous of indistinct Japanese websites.\n\n\n# How can I help VNDB?\n\nThere are many ways to contribute to VNDB. First of all you can freely edit all information found on this website, so if you find any errors just click the "edit" link on the top right of the page. You can also add new information to the database, though please search the database before you do in order to prevent duplicate pages.\n\nTo discuss new features or to help the development of the website itself, feel free to participate on the [discussion board](/t).\n\n\n# Where can I download the Visual Novels?\n\nNot here. We do not provide any links to direct downloads, torrents or other means of downloading games. We do, however, link to the official homepages of the producers, who may provide free trials or even full game downloads.\n\nOur stance on piracy is that patches and downloads that have modifications to the game's contents are allowed. This includes translation patches and restoration patches. Any downloads, tools, cracks or codes that have the sole purpose of avoiding the purchase of a game are considered piracy and should not be discussed on this site.\n\n\n# Can you recommend me a Visual Novel?\n\nAsking for recommendations on the discussion board is usually not a good idea, for various reasons.  If you're looking for VNs that most people have played, check out the [popularity rankings](/v/all?s=pop;o=d).  If you're interested in VNs that are generally considered "good" or "awesome", check out the [ratings](/v/all?s=rating;o=d). If you're looking for something specific, [browse through the tags](/g). If you're interested in a more personal answer, compare the vote lists of our [users](/u/all) with your own and decide what to read next based on that.\n\nSome external sites can help, too:\n\n- The [Fuwanovel recommendation site](https://fuwanovel.net/quiz/) offers personalized recommendations based on a short quiz.\n- [VNStat](https://vnstat.net/) provides, among many other features, personalized recommendations based on votes, tags, traits, and more.\n\nIf you prefer a human answer, you can also ask around at the following communities:\n\n- [/r/vnsuggest](https://www.reddit.com/r/vnsuggest)\n- [/r/visualnovelsuggest](https://www.reddit.com/r/visualnovelsuggest)\n- [/r/visualnovels](https://www.reddit.com/r/visualnovels) - Not intended for recommendations, but a good resource to ask for general VN help.\n- You may also try the [/r/visualnovels Discord](https://discord.gg/Z6skErt) or the [Fuwanovel Discord](https://discord.gg/F79q4dp).\n\n\n# Who's that girl on the background?\n\nIf you don't have an account on VNDB or you've never played around with your profile settings, then the answer you're looking for is [Lasty Farson](/c3005) from [Angelic Serenade](/v1280). If you do have an account then you can simply go to your profile page and check which skin you're using - the name of the skin tells you where it's from.\n\n\n# I found this awesome game, but it's not available in English!?\n\nShit happens. There are several things to keep in mind: first of all, if our database does not have a translation listed, then with a *very* high probability it simply does not exist, anywhere. Second, we don't translate these games ourselves and we do not coordinate the translations, either, so asking for a translation here is rather pointless and a sure-fire way to get your thread locked. Also, there is an order of magnitude more visual novels than there are translators within this community. :-(\n\n\n# Can I link to VNDB?\n\nOf course you can! We even have some icons you could use to link to and promote VNDB. Direct linking is, as with all other images on this site, allowed.\n\n![0](//s.vndb.org/linkimg/vndb0.gif)\n![1](//s.vndb.org/linkimg/vndb1.gif)\n![2](//s.vndb.org/linkimg/vndb2.jpg)\n![3](//s.vndb.org/linkimg/vndb3.jpg)\n![4](//s.vndb.org/linkimg/vndb4.jpg)\n![5](//s.vndb.org/linkimg/vndb5.jpg)\n![6](//s.vndb.org/linkimg/vndb6.jpg)\n\nIf you feel these banners don't suit your needs, please don't hesitate to make one yourself.
d7	About us	# Goal\n\nOur primary goal is building a large, comprehensive and up-to-date database for information about all existing visual novels. VNDB aims to be a central place to look up general information about the visual novels themselves, as well as practical information around it, like available releases, localisations and producers.\n\nOur secondary goal is to promote the wonderful medium called visual novels to a broader audience, an audience not limited only to people who can understand Japanese, but to anyone interested in literature, anime, manga or games, regardless of their geographical location or cultural differences.\n\n\n\n# Genesis\n\nIt all started right after [yorhel](/u2) finished reading [Ever17](/v17). Highly impressed by the masterpiece, several questions came to his mind: After learning about visual novels, why did it still take several months to find this game? Why hasn't he ever heard about it before?  How can a visual novel of that quality go by unnoticed in almost all online anime and gaming communities? And more importantly: Are there more visual\nnovels like that out there?\n\nVNDB was born to answer that last question. The complete lack of any central resource for, or even a simple list of visual novels made it very hard to find new games or get a good overview of what was available. Having a central and well-organized place where everyone can share their information and knowledge about visual novels would solve this problem.\n\nAfter a short three weeks of hard work, the first version of VNDB saw the light of day in September 2007. The obscurity and small fanbase around visual novels, combined with the bare minimum of features and the rigid contribution system in use at the time, made that the database only grew at a slow pace. But with time more people learned about VNDB, new and advanced features were being introduced, and in response more visitors started contributing information. The introduction of an improved and open contribution system in February 2008 motivated even more users to submit information, and as of September 2008 - a year after the initial version of VNDB - the database catalogues more than 1000 visual novels and 2000 releases, which still continues to grow in size and quality today.\n\n\n# Credits\n\n**Code development**\n \nYorhel\n: Main developer.\n\nQCyph\n: Contributed the character filters.\n\n3dB\n: Contributed improved user authentication code and post throttling on the discussion board.\n\nSpaceRanger\n: Contributed the visual novel release comparison page, userlist columns to the VN list and dx.x.x link formatting.\n\nmorkt\n: Contributed the staff database and lots of other stuff.\n\nflan\n: Contributed Open graph tags and test cases for the BBCode parser.\n\nTigerShark\n: Contributed release icons.\n\n**Special users**\n:MODERATORS:\n\n\n**Skins**\n:SKINCONTRIB:
d8	VNDB Development	# The Source\n\nVNDB is open source. The full source code of the site is available as a [git repository](https://code.blicky.net/yorhel/vndb).You can use it to track changes to the code, run your own instance of VNDB and contribute to issues or pull requests. Check the README in the git repository for instructions.\n\nVNDB is built on the following technologies:\n\n- [Perl](https://www.perl.org/)\n- [TUWF](https://dev.yorhel.nl/tuwf)\n- [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/)\n\n\n# Contributing\n\nCode contributions are more than welcome! For small bug fixes or minor and undisputed improvements, feel free to send a patch or pull request without prior discussion. If you have an idea for a new feature, I strongly recommend opening a thread on the forums to get some feedback before you start coding. Otherwise you may be wasting your time on features that aren't even welcomed in the community or could have been better integrated with other parts of the site. For ideas of projects to work on, check out the list of [open issues](https://code.blicky.net/yorhel/vndb/issues).\n\nIf you are stuck, don't hesitate to ask for help on [IRC](irc://irc.synirc.net/vndb) or on [the forums](/t/db).\n\n\n# Development Database\n\n**File:** [vndb-dev-latest.tar.gz](https://dl.vndb.org/dump/vndb-dev-latest.tar.gz) ([more files](https://dl.vndb.org/dump/)).\n\n**Updated:** Sporadically.\n\nWhen working on the VNDB code, it helps to have a local development database with some realistic data. This database dump includes a small subset of the production database to play around with. Usage instructions can be found in the README in the git repository.\n\nThe dump includes:\n\n- The complete tags and traits database\n- All 'doc' pages\n- All threads made on the 'announcement' board\n- A small selection of popular visual novel entries\n- All releases, producers, characters and staff related to these visual novels\n- All images related to the above database entries\n- The full edit history of these entries\n- An admin user and a few test users (their password is 'hunter2' if the crypt_salt configuration option is the same as the example file).\n\n\n# Wishlist\n\nVNDB can be improved in an infinite number of ways. Here's a very incomplete list of a few features we'd like to have at some point, in no particular order.\n\n- More modern, mobile-friendly design (without sacrificing performance and functionality, of course).\n- Custom title languages for releases, characters, producers and staff entries.\n- User-contributed "similar visual novels".\n- Cover images for releases ([t14195](/t14195))\n- Character relations ([t3314.1994](/t3314.1994) & [t15655](/t15655))
d9	Discussion board	# Introduction\n\nVNDB has a nicely integrated discussion board which can be used for, well, discussions. As we're not using any popular or freely available forum software and have instead written something by ourselves, this discussion board has a few slight differences with the popular boards you're used to.\n\n\n# Rules\n\n1. Don't be an ass.<br>\n    1a. Don't voice your opinion in threads for which you are obviously not the target audience.<br>\n    1b. Respect other people's opinions, even if you disagree with them. In particular, this means that you should accept that people hold their own opinions and that you're unlikely to succeed in convincing them otherwise. Know when to give up an argument.<br>\n    1c. Hate speech, racism, discrimination and anti-LGBTQ sentiments are unwelcome here. Of course, considering the nature of this database, it's fine to discuss these topics in the context of visual novels, but VNDB is not the place to relate these topics to the real world. Don't use visual novels as a proxy to voice your opinions about reality.\n2. Stick to the topic.<br>\n    2a. All discussions must be related to visual novels or to VNDB.<br>\n    2b. Don't ask for visual novel recommendations, unless you're looking for something specific that the database can't be used for. See [d6#6](/d6#6).<br>\n    2c. Try not to shitpost, bait, troll or meme too much.\n3. Don't share links to piracy sites and don't ask for free downloads of commercial visual novels.\n4. Only revive old threads if you have something new to add to the conversation.\n5. Moderators are always right. The above rules are incomplete, (intentionally) subjective and may not be enforced with perfect consistency. This may seem unfair at times, but such is life.\n\n\n\n# Boards\n\nTo make sure interested people can find your post, all threads have relations to one or more 'boards' that define what the discussion is about. This is similar to boards on other forums, but here every item in the DB has its own board, and it's possible to link a thread to more than one board. Multiple boards can be specified by separating the boards with a space. The following boards can be used:\n\ndb\n: VNDB Discussions. This board is for discussions about the database and the site.\n\nge\n: General discussions. This is a general board for threads that do not fit in any of the other boards.\n\nv#\n: For discussions about a particular visual novel. The board _v17_, for example, is used for all threads related to [v17](/v17).\n\np#\n: Same as _v#_, but for producers.\n\nu#\n: The _u#_ board can be used to notify a user on this site about something he/she must see or to discuss about an edit he/she has made. This is similar to the 'private message' feature of most sites, except it's not 'private'...\n\nan\n: Used for site announcements. Limited to moderators.\n \n\n\n# Formatting\n\nThe following codes can be used to format your message:\n\nX# or X#.#\n: A 'VNDBID', as we call them. These are numbers starting with a character (c, d, p, r, s, u or v), and are optionally followed by a period and a second number. VNDBIDs will automatically be converted into links to the page on the website. For example, typing 'v4.4' will result in '[v4.4](/v4.4)'.\n\nURL\n: Any bare URL will be converted into a link, similar to the VNDBIDs. Example: 'http://vndb.org/' will be formatted as '[link](http://vndb.org/)'.\n\n[b]\n: [b]Bold[/b] makes text **bold**.\n\n[i]\n: [i]Italic[/i] makes text *italic*.\n\n[u]\n: [u]Underlined[/u] makes text <span class="underline">underlined</span>.\n\n[s]\n: [s]Strike[/s] will <s>strike through</s> text.\n\n[url]\n: Create a link, can only be used in the form of _[url=link]link title[/url]_.\n: E.g. '[url=/v]List of visual novels[/url] and [url=http://blicky.net/]some external website[/url]' will be displayed as '[List of visual novels](/v) and [some external website](http://blicky.net/)'\n\n[spoiler]\n: The [spoiler]-tag should be used to hide information that could spoil the enjoyment of playing the visual novel for people who haven't done so yet.\n\n[quote]\n: When quoting other people, put the quoted message inside a [quote] .. [/quote] block. Please note that the popular [quote=source]-syntax doesn't work on VNDB. (yet)\n\n[raw]\n: Show off your formatting code skills by putting anything you don't want to have formatted in a [raw] tag. Any of the formatting codes mentioned above are ignored within a [raw] .. [/raw] block.\n\n[code]\n: Similar to [raw], except that the text within the [code] .. [/code] block is formatted in a fixed width font and surrounded by a nice box to keep it separate from the rest of your post.\n\nThere is no [img]-tag and there won't likely ever be one, if you want to include screenshots or other images, please upload them to an external hosting service (e.g. [Blicky.net](https://f.blicky.net/)) and link to them in your post.
d10	Tags & traits	# Introduction\n\nVNDB has a system for tags and one for traits. Tags are used to categorize **visual novels**, while traits tell something about **characters**. This also makes them somewhat different in use. This page describes some general guidelines and tips on using tags and traits.\n\n\n# Tags\n\nTags can be assigned to visual novel entries using a voting system. Every user can add a tag to a visual novel by going to the "modify tags" tab of a visual novel page.\n\n\n## Tag voting\n\nTags can be assigned a vote from 1 to 3. This vote should be interpreted as follows:\n\n- **1**: The tag does apply to the visual novel, but is not too apparent or only plays a minor role.\n- **2**: The tag certainly applies to the visual novel.\n- **3**: The tag applies, is very apparent and plays a major role.\n- Additionally, if you believe that a tag does not apply at all you can also downvote it. \n\nWhile everyone is pretty much free to link any tag to any visual novel, please keep the following in mind while voting:\n\n- Read the description of each tag before you link it to a VN: some tags may not always mean what you think they do.\n- Try to be as specific as you can. For example, if a game has drama elements, rather than voting on the "Drama" tag, try to look for a more specific child tag that describes what kind of drama a player can expect.\n- Some tags can act as spoilers for the plot of a VN, this can be indicated by voting on the spoiler status. It is highly recommended to not leave this as "Neutral", and really try to give an indication of whether the tag is not a spoiler at all or does spoil a bit.\n- Tags are supposed to reflect the things you'll be experiencing as you play the game, even if some things might get revealed to be lies or illusions towards the end of the story. In cases like this, add both the (arguably incorrect) tags and the tags describing the situation after the truth has been revealed, making sure to mark the "correct" tags as spoilers and the incorrect tags as lies.\n\n\n## Tag creation guidelines\n\nNew tags can be requested by everyone, but they'll have to be accepted by a moderator before the tags will be browsable. Applying the following guidelines significantly increases the chances that your tag will be accepted and lowers the workload of the moderator team.\n\n- Tag names should be self-describing. While the meaning of a tag can be obvious if you look at its place within the tag tree, when displayed on a VN page only their name is visible and not the parent tags. The name should thus fully describe what the tag means and should be used for. For example: a tag to describe a male protagonist should be fully named "Male protagonist", even if its parent tag is "Characters &gt; Protagonist".\n- Tags should be used to describe objective information about a VN. Subjective tags like "Awesome protagonist", which would have a different meaning for each individual, are not allowed.\n- Tags should only cover information that VNDB itself doesn't cover already. So tags about release information or the length of a VN are not allowed.\n- The above rule also holds true for any other information about the VN itself which is (not yet) covered by VNDB, like staff or licensed state in a country.\n\n\n# Traits\n\nTraits can be assigned to characters. Contrary to tags, traits can't be voted on. Instead, traits are part of the editing system, and modifying the traits for a certain character involves editing the character entry itself.\n\n## Assigning traits\n\nUnlike tags, traits don't have any "levels": a trait either applies to the character or it does not. Here are some guidelines and tips when assigning traits to characters:\n\n- If no traits are present yet and you're the first person to add traits, please try to be as complete as possible. Browse through the [trait tree](/i) and try to find as many traits that apply to the character as possible.\n- Spoilery traits should *always* be marked as such.\n\n\n## Trait creation\n\nAnyone can request new traits to be added to the database. However, these need to be approved by a moderator before they can actually be assigned to a character.\n\nTraits are categorized into "groups", the top-most trait in the tree defines in which group a trait is. Unlike tags, traits don't need to have a globally unique name, but they must be unique and self-describing within the same group. For example, there can be multiple traits with the name "Blue", but one is in the "Hair" group while the other is in the "Eyes" group. So make sure to keep the group in mind when naming a trait.\n\nRead the descriptions of the various trait groups and meta traits to get a feel on how they are supposed to be used.
d11	Public Database API	# APIs\n\nThere are two APIs to interact with the database:\n\n- [New HTTPS-based API](https://api.vndb.org/kana): This API should be preferred for new applications. It's still in development and missing some features, but you can [request a feature on the forums](/t19211) if you're missing anything.\n- [Legacy TCP-based API](https://api.vndb.org/nyan): The old API will (hopefully) remain available for as long as it is being used, but it's not actively being developed anymore and may thus lag behind on features.\n\nBoth APIs are for non-commercial use only and our [data license](/d17#4) applies to any data obtained through the APIs.\n\nIf you're more interested in bulk data than real-time querying, consider using the [database dumps](/d14) instead. All information available through the API is also available through the dumps.\n\nWhat follows is a list of public applications and libraries that make use of the API. These lists are incomplete, feel free to announce your project on the forums to have it added. These projects are not directly affiliated with VNDB, so use at your own risk. \n\n# Applications\n\n- [flutter-vndb](https://github.com/chengyuhui/flutter-vndb) (Mobile/web UI, in development, [thread](/t19235))\n- [Happy Reader](https://github.com/Zoltanar/Happy-Reader/) (Windows UI)\n- [Trackma](https://z411.github.io/trackma/) (Multiple UIs, for Unix-like systems)\n- [VNDB Android](https://gitlab.com/thomas_herbeth/VNDBA) (slightly outdated, not actively maintained)\n- [VNDB Nexus](https://playnite.link/addons.html#VNDBNexus_39229206-1199-4fee-a014-e8478ea4cd77) (Playnite add-on)\n- [VnManager](https://github.com/micah686/VnManager) (Windows UI, [thread](/t15637))\n\nUser scripts:\n\n- [VNDB Steam Enhancer](https://greasyfork.org/en/scripts/456166-vndb-steam-enhancer/code) - Enhance Steam app pages with data from VNDB.

d12	Adding/Editing Characters	# Introduction\n\nCharacters represent persons, animals and things within a visual novel. Any character in a visual novel, no matter how obscure their role is, may be added to the database, although it is recommended to at least add the more important characters first. When adding characters, try to be complete: That is, try to add as many characters of a single visual novel, rather than adding a single character to many VNs.\n\n\n# Instances\n\nYou can link two (or more) characters with an "instance relationship" when they are, in some way, the same person.\n\n## Where instances might be suitable\n\n- The two characters seemed to be different people, but were actually the same person.  For example, [Arsene](/c7373) and [Henriette](/c7374).\n- One of the characters is an older version of the other.\n- One character transforms into the other. There does not need to be a way for them to transform back.  For example, [Kaoru (Male)](/c1022) and [Kaoru (Female)](/c1023).\n- The two characters are the same character in different universes, timelines or realities.  For example, Tohsaka Rin [in Fate/stay night](/c34) and in [in Fate/extra](/c3529).\n- The two characters are the same character used by different developers. This may result in different interpretations of the character or different art styles.  For example, Emiya Shirou [in Fate/stay night](/c15) and in [in Happy Valentines Day](/c4479).\n- Spoilers about the character need to be hidden. This may be done by creating a character entry with incorrect or incomplete, but non-spoiling information. This is linked to another entry for the same character with complete, but spoiling information.\n\n\n## Where instances might not be suitable\n\n- It is preferable to avoid using instances just to hide spoilers if other methods would be effective. These methods include marking traits as spoilers and hiding information within spoiler tags in the character description.\n- If the two characters to be linked by an instance are not sufficiently different, they should just use one character entry.  For example, [Alice (lamia)](/c4287) and [Alice (human)](http://s.vndb.org/sf/26/18226.jpg).\n\n\n## How to use instances\n\nTo link two (or more) characters with an instance relationship, you must choose one character to be the "main character". All others will be "instance characters". (Do not confuse this with a character's role in a visual novel.) Usually, the most often seen or least spoiling character should be the "main character".\n\nDo not fill the "Instance of" field when editing the "main character", but fill it for the "instance characters". If the instance relation is a spoiler, make sure to mark it as such when editing the "instance characters". If the existence of a character in a visual novel is a spoiler, see the [Visual Novels](/d12#6) section below.\n\n\n# General info\n\nName (original)\n: Name of the character, in the original script of the visual novel. If possible, try to include a space between the given name and surname. \n: Try to use the full name when known. If the full name is not known, then use either the first or last name. If even that isn't known, use the name that is most commonly used to refer to this character in the story.  In the case the character is never referred to with a name or title (e.g.  it's the protagonist), "Unnamed" can be used as name.\n: For nameable characters use their default name if one exists. Characters that do not have a default name can be called by their function or title, e.g. Protagonist.\n: In some cases the full name is a spoiler, see the chapter on instances above for some ways to handle that.\n\nName (latin)\n: Only if the original name is not already in the Latin alphabet. Check out the [general editing guidelines](/d5) for information on name order and romanization. Whenever the romanization provided by the developer or the publisher conflicts with the VNDB editing guidelines, in all instances the latter trumps the former.\n\nAliases\n: Other names this character is known by, such as nick names used by other characters within the story, or names appearing in the supplemental sources provided by the developer. Since this field does not have any option to hide spoilers, you shouldn't include spoilery names here. It is possible to mention such aliases with a [spoiler] tag in the description.\n\nDescription\n: A short description of the character. While it is advised to keep the spoilers to a minimum, you can use the usual [formatting codes](/d9#3) such as [spoiler] to include spoilers while hiding them by default.  When using a description from external sources, check out the [general editing guidelines](/d5#5) for quoting rules.\n\nSex\n: Character's sex. This is usually rather straightforward, but there are some odd cases: (Reverse) traps should have their biological sex filled out here. Futanari should be marked as "both".\n: If the real sex is a spoiler, which is sometimes the case with traps, the sex field should correspond to a character's apparent sex as presented by the narrative. For example, if we are led to believe by the story that a character is female, with a later revelation to the contrary, the sex should be marked as 'female' in order to minimize the spoilers within the database.\n: Where the character's actual biological sex is unknown, which might be the case in some all-ages titles, the character's assumed gender should be entered into the sex field.\n: See the chapter on instances above if the character "transforms" between a male and female version.\n\nBirthday\n: Month and day of the character's birthday. Note that a year is not included.\n\nBust / Waist / Hips\n: [BWH](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BWH) measurements, if known.  This information should either come from the game itself or from a reliable source (usually the official homepage). Don't try to guess these!\n: If the official source does not provide this information as a natural number, the number should rounded to allow its use in the database. If the official information is not in the metric system, convert the numbers and round them before entering.\n\nHeight\n: Height of the character, in cm. The above note on natural numbers and the metric system also applies here.\n\nWeight\n: Weight of the character, in kg. The above note on natural numbers and the metric system also applies here.\n\nBlood type\n: Blood type, if known and applicable. This makes little sense if the character isn't a human.\n \n\n# Image\n\nThere is a lot of freedom with regards to uploading an image to a character entry, but the following is a list of things to keep in mind:\n\n- The image must be official, i.e. it must be extracted from the VN itself or from the official homepage. Fan art is definitely not allowed!\n- This image should be chosen from an image that is showing the most common clothing and facial expression the character wears through the game.\n- In-game sprites (tachi-e) are preferred, whether they include the background art from the game, or are overlaid over neutral (commonly black or white) background. Cuts from CGs are allowed, too.\n- The image must at least include the head (assuming it has one) and shoulders of the character. Full-body shots are fine, but legs are generally not that interesting yet cause the overall image to shrink dramatically.\n- The image size maxes out at a resolution of 256x300, so larger images will be downsized while preserving the aspect ratio. It is recommended to crop the images manually before uploading, to ensure that all character images of the same VN have the same width. This consistency looks better on the character listing on the VN page.\n\n\n# Traits\n\nSee the [Tags &amp; traits](/d10) page for guidelines on the traits.\n\n\n# Visual Novels\n\nA character should always be linked to at least one visual novel entry, but may be linked with more when it appears in multiple visual novels.\n\nIf a character appears in all releases of the visual novel, with the possible exception of trial releases, then simply keep one release and leave it at "All (full) releases". In other situations, mention explicitly in which releases the character appears and which role they have in that release. Multiple releases can be added with the same role and spoiler information.\n\nIf a characters' role or the entire existence of that character in the visual novel is a spoiler, make sure to mark it as such.\n\nThe following roles are available:\n\nProtagonist\n: The (or "a") protagonist. The person through which the story is told. Note that a significant portion of the story has to be told through the eyes of the character for it to be considered a protagonist. Some visual novels may switch perspectives for a (relatively) short amount of time, but this does not always make the character a protagonist.\n\nMain character\n: A character that plays a major role in the story or gets a lot of screen time. In general, a heroine with an own route always qualifies and so do sidekicks/classmates that are very often seen.\n\nSide character\n: A character that plays a minor role or does not get a lot of screen time.  This is often the case for characters that appear only in a single branch or a single part of the story, although this is not a mandatory.\n\nMakes an appearance\n: This role is used for characters that only appear in the story for a short while and have only very little to no lines of dialog. Often used for [cameo appearances](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cameo_appearance).\n \n\nNote that there is no distinct line between these roles, and one could have endless (and often rather pointless) discussions about the actual role of a character. Simply assign the role that you think most naturally fits the character. To get some inspiration, look around for characters in other visual novels that play a somewhat similar role.
d13	How to Capture Screenshots	# Introduction\n\nScreenshots uploaded to VNDB must confirm to [some strict guidelines](/d2#6). In particular, they should not have any window borders and must be in the correct resolution (precise to the pixel!). Uploading screenshots that do not confirm to these rules will likely result in them getting deleted shortly afterwards.  This page is a tutorial on how to **correctly** capture screenshots using various tools.\n\n\n# IrfanView\n\n1. Download and install Irfanview from [irfanview.com](http://www.irfanview.com/). Installation should be fairly straight-forward.\n2. Start Irfanview, you should get a window like [this](https://s.vndb.org/sf/24/103524.jpg).\n3. Hit the _C_ key or go _Options -> Capture/Screenshot_ to open the [capture setup](https://s.vndb.org/sf/26/103526.jpg) window.\n4. Check the "Foreground window - client area" selection box. This option makes sure that you won't see any window borders and that the screenshot is already correctly cropped.\n5. Set a hot key. Irfanview uses Ctrl+F11 by default, but since the Ctrl is usually assigned to skipping in most games, you will probably want to change it. To do so, left-click on the key area and press the desired key combination.  Alt+F11 should do the trick.\n6. Check the "Save captured image as file", choose a destination folder and select JPG in the "Save as" options.\n7. Click "Options" to open the [JPEG save options](https://s.vndb.org/sf/25/103525.jpg) window.\n8. Set the quality somewhere between 95 and 100.\n9. Press "OK", and then press "Start" to close the capture setup window.\n\nNow go to the visual novel you want to capture and press the configured hot key at the desired moment. Irfanview will automatically capture and save the screenshot in the chosen directory. Most of the time these screenshots are suitable for uploading to VNDB without further modifications. \n\nOn some engines, Irfanview does not behave correctly and adds a border 2px wide to the taken screenshots. In such cases, the screenshots should be manually edited by cropping out the border in an image editing software before uploading them.\n\n\n# ShareX\n\n1. Download and install ShareX from [getsharex.com](https://getsharex.com/downloads/).\n2. Start ShareX, you should then get a window like [this](https://s.vndb.org/sf/63/103563.jpg).\n3. Go to [Task settings](https://s.vndb.org/sf/66/103566.jpg) and adjust your [capture settings](https://s.vndb.org/sf/62/103562.jpg) and [image settings](https://s.vndb.org/sf/61/103561.jpg).\n4. You can set a custom hotkey for window capture: Go to [Hotkey settings](https://s.vndb.org/sf/71/103571.jpg) and change the [default hotkey for window capture](https://s.vndb.org/sf/64/103564.jpg).\n5. Change the [After capture tasks](https://s.vndb.org/sf/65/103565.jpg) according to your preferences</a>.\n6. (Tip) If you want to change the directory where screenshots will be saved, go to [Application settings](https://s.vndb.org/sf/68/103568.jpg) and [follow these steps](https://s.vndb.org/sf/67/103567.jpg).\n7. (Tip) You can change the naming pattern of the saved screenshots by going to the [Task settings](https://s.vndb.org/sf/69/103569.jpg) and [following these steps](https://s.vndb.org/sf/70/103570.jpg).\n\nNow go to the visual novel you want to capture and press the configured hot key at the desired moment. The saved screenshots can be uploaded to VNDB without further modifications.
d14	Database Dumps	# Introduction\n\nThis page lists and documents any provided database dumps. These dumps are complimentary to the [real-time API](/d11), and the usage terms that apply to the API apply here as well.\n\n\n# Tags\n\n**File:** [vndb-tags-latest.json.gz](https://dl.vndb.org/dump/vndb-tags-latest.json.gz) ([more files](https://dl.vndb.org/dump/)).\n\n**Updated:** Every day around 8:00 UTC.\n\n**License:**  [Open Database License](https://opendatacommons.org/licenses/odbl/1.0/) + [Database Contents License](https://opendatacommons.org/licenses/dbcl/1.0/), see our [Data License](/d17#4) for more information.\n\nThis dump includes information about all (approved) VN tags in the JSON format.

The first element in this array points to the primary parent trait.\n\nUnlike with tags, trait names and aliases are neither globally unique nor self-describing.  If you wish to display a trait (name) to the user, you should do so in combination with its associated root trait. For example, [i112](/i112) is often displayed as "Eyes > Green", to differentiate it with [i50](/i50), which is "Hair > Green". The root trait can be found by following the primary parents until you've ended up on the trait with an empty parents array.\n\n\n\n# Votes\n\n**File:** [vndb-votes-latest.gz](https://dl.vndb.org/dump/vndb-votes-latest.gz) ([more files](https://dl.vndb.org/dump/)).\n\n**Updated:** Every day around 8:00 UTC.\n\n**License:**  [Open Database License](https://opendatacommons.org/licenses/odbl/1.0/), see our [Data License](/d17#4) for more information.\n\nThis dump contains the VN votes of all users who did not mark their vote list as private.

Prefer incremental updates over redownloading a full copy, but don't scan for updates more than once a day - the published files aren't updated more often than that anyway.
d15	Special Games	# Introduction\n\nWe have [inclusion guidelines](/d2#1) to determine whether or not a game should be added to this database. You will want to read those first, otherwise the rest of this page will not make much sense. This page addresses some common questions around the inclusion guidelines and lists a few commonly contested games with a short explanation for why they are or aren't included.\n\n# FAQ\n\n## Your guidelines don't make sense!\n\nVNDB exists for a very specific type of game, "visual novel" is the term that we ended up choosing to describe such games. Pretty much nobody disputes that these games can be called "visual novels", but disagreements happen around the borders with similar genres such as adventure games, dating sims, RPGs, interactive fiction, etc. Some people believe that the "visual novel" genre encompasses all narrative-focussed or text-heavy games, while others limit it to games that have no gameplay whatsoever except for the occasional choice.  There is no real consensus, anywhere, in any community, about what a "visual novel" really is, but either way it doesn't change the type of games that we cater to. The guidelines exist to determine whether or not a game fits in the database irrespective of any individual's interpretation of the term "visual novel".\n\n## Why not just include VN-like games?\n\nOur guidelines do allow visual novels with gameplay elements to be added to the database, to a certain extent. But even with that we have to draw a line *somewhere*, or we'll end up as yet-another-generic-game database. We have no ambition to become an "obscure Japanese game database", nor a "porn game database", or "database for &lt;related-community&gt;" or "game database for visual novels fans" (hint: visual novel fans have wildly varying tastes in video games, so that will not work at all).\n\nBut why not expand the scope of the database to include every video game in existence? Because then we'll lose our focus on visual novels - which is presumably the reason you're here in the first place.\n\n## Why are you so inconsistent?\n\nThe goal is to be mostly consistent, but that sadly doesn't always work out as well as we would like, for several reasons:\n\n- *Anyone* can add games to the database, there is no approval process at all.  We're low-staffed on moderators who have time and are willing to check and verify games, so we're often lagging behind and have to rely on user reports to prioritize games to check. It's not unheard of for a game to be in the database for years before it's brought to our attention, especially if it's not a well-known title.\n- Some non-visual novel games were added to the database before our current inclusion guidelines came into effect. These have been "grandfathered" into the database and are allowed to stay, for now. A few popular entries are mentioned below.\n- Given that the inclusion guidelines are not perfect and can be ambiguous in some cases, *perfect* consistency is completely impossible to achieve even if the above points were somehow addressed.\n\nAnother very common reason why people believe the database is inconsistent is because they apply their own definition of what makes a visual novel, rather than the guidelines that we use. The entire notion of "consistency" is kind of meaningless if that's how you go about it...\n\nAn existing inconsistency in the database, whether real or perceived, is never an argument to include more non-VN games into the database.\n\n## Why did you delete game X when game Y is still in the database!?\n\nSee above points and the list of games below. The most common reason is that we've simply not checked game Y yet. If you're arguing for the inclusion of a particular game, it's rarely a good idea to refer to similar games, because a game being in the database does not always mean that it actually adheres to our inclusion guidelines.\n\n# Deleted Games\n\nThe following is a list of games that have been (proposed to be) included in the database, but that were removed or rejected. These games are **not** visual novels and will **not** be reinstated.\n\n- **The Disgaea series (except for Infinite)**<br>\n  _They are TRPGs with no narration or uninterrupted VN segments._\n- **Persona 3/4**<br>\n  _They are JRPGs and have no narration or VN segments._\n- **Ghost Trick**<br>\n  _A Puzzle/Adventure game with no narration._\n- **Princess Maker 1/2/3**<br>\n  _Pure raising sims with no narration or VN segments._\n- **Battle Moon Wars**<br>\n  _Super Robot Wars style TRPG with no narration._\n- **The Shin Megami Tensei series**<br>\n  _RPGs/TRPGs with no narration._\n- **The Touhou games**<br>\n  _Bullet hell shooters with only token character interactions._\n- **Record of Agarest War / Agarest Senki**<br>\n  _No narration and very low story/gameplay ratio._\n- **To The Moon**<br>\n  _An adventure game with no narration._\n- **13 Sentinels: Aegis Rim**<br>\n  _An adventure game with no narration or VN parts. Almost all dialogue happens through speech bubbles (meaning very few ADV or NVL sections) and is constantly interrupted by short walking and interactive parts, even when not counting the Tactical RPG portions of the game._\n\n# Borderline Games\n\nThe following is a lists of few games that **are** included in the database, but are very much borderline cases. When arguing for another game to be included, do **not, ever,** refer to these games as examples.\n\n- **The Ar Tonélico series**<br>\n  _The series is in the database because of the Cosmosphere sections, which are long, uninterrupted VN segments. The rest of the game might be a relatively typical JRPG, but it doesn't matter in this case._\n- **The Phoenix Wright series**<br>\n  _The games are only considered VNs in the broadest sense, and thus they should not be cited as examples for inclusion. They are considered one of the few "mod approved" games that stay in the DB mostly because of reasons not necessarily related to the guidelines (in this case that removing them would cause more problems than keeping them)._\n- **The Melty Blood series**<br>\n  _The only reason the series is in the DB is because the first game has narration and proper VN segments, and while the rest are straight up fighting games, they are only considered different releases of said game._\n- **The BlazBlue series**<br>\n  _The game has narration in the ADV VN segments between battles and these segments are extensive enough to qualify it, if only barely._\n- **The Rance series and other turn-based Alice Soft titles**<br>\n  _VN hybrids, Sengoku Rance in particular has a lot of narration, and while there is a lot of gameplay in them, they still qualify._\n- **Castle Fantasia 2**<br>\n  _No consistent narration, but otherwise the game fulfills all other VN requirements, so it is kept as-is._\n- **The Corpse Party series (except for the original and Rebuilded)**<br>\n  _The games have narration and event CGs, which qualify it over the lack of ADV/NVL presentation._\n- **The School Days series (Shiny Days, Summer Days, etc.)**<br>\n  _While it would be arguable that the games are more "interactive anime" instead of VNs, they have rudimentary narration and other VN elements to qualify, albeit barely. They are the second most borderline "mod approved" keepers beside the Phoenix Wright series._\n- **999 / Kyokugen Dasshutsu 9-Jikan 9-Nin 9 no Tobira / 9 Hours, 9 Persons, 9 Doors**<br>\n  _A pure VN with puzzles. I don't even know why people like to bring it up as an example, but it is a proper VN with narration and every other necessary aspect._\n- **The Lightning Warrior Raidy series**<br>\n  _The games are mostly dungeon crawlers, but they have enough narrated ADV segments to warrant their presence in the DB, albeit barely._\n- **Kamidori and other Eushully games**<br>\n  _These games have very extensive TRPG gameplay and crafting systems, but they also have equally extensive, uninterrupted and narrated VN segments throughout the games._\n- **Danganronpa series**<br>\n  _While dialogues are numerous, these are mostly very long, made in a VN format (sprites, background and ADV text box). Besides the investigation parts, the mini-games never interrupt the reading parts for long amounts of time and aren't very long, even during class trials._
d16	Adding/Editing Staff Members	# Introduction\n\nStaff entries represent individuals and groups that play significant roles in visual novels production, such as script writers, character designers, artists, voice actors, composers and singers.\n\n\n# General info\n\nNames\n: People involved in visual novel production often hide behind multiple aliases. These aliases can be listed here. Add only aliases that are actually used in VN credits. Sometimes names with different Japanese spellings are romanized equally. You may add such aliases, but in that case the original spelling should be used when that name is being looked up in the VN staff edit form.\n: One of the aliases can be selected as the primary name of the staff entry.  In the absense of a clearly stated preference of the person involved, this is typically either the person's true name (if known, and if the person has used their true name in the context of VNs) or, alternatively, the most widely used alias.\n: Check out the [general editing guidelines](/d5) for information on name order and romanization. If possible, try to include a space between the given name and the surname.\n\nGender\n: Person's gender, if known.\n\nPrimary language\n: Native language, Japanese by default.\n\nStaff note\n: Brief note describing biography, occupation and production companies affiliations, if any.  It's fine to leave this field empty if there's nothing much known about the person in question.\n\nOfficial page\n: Link to the official page or blog.\n\nAdditional links\n: You can also provide links to Wikidata, Twitter, AniDB and Pixiv using their corresponding ID.\n: For Twitter, only the username should be used, without the "@" symbol.\n: For AniDB and pixiv, the ID is a numeric value located at the end of their respective urls.\n: For Wikidata links, the ID is located at the end of the url and after the title of an entry (called items). They always start with the letter Q followed by a numeric value (e.g. for [Shikura Chiyomaru](/s441), the Wikidata ID is [Q9036726](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q9036726)). Once a Wikidata ID has been added, the database will automatically fetch some additional links based on the information present on that website. This process can take from a few seconds to several hours, but not more than a day. Currently, the websites added with this method are: [Wikipedia (English)](https://en.wikipedia.org/), [Wikipedia (Japanese)](https://ja.wikipedia.org/), [Twitter](https://twitter.com/), [AniDB](https://anidb.net/), [pixiv](https://www.pixiv.net/), [VGMdb](https://vgmdb.net/), [Discogs](https://www.discogs.com/), [MusicBrainz](https://musicbrainz.org/), [Doujinshi.org](https://www.doujinshi.org/) and [SoundCloud](https://soundcloud.com/).\n: Note that the database will show all twitter usernames present on a Wikidata item, making it possible to have multiple twitter links in a single entry. However, if the twitter ID from the staff entry is filled, it will replace all twitter links fetched from Wikidata. The same goes for AniDB and pixiv links.

d19	Image Flagging	Images are flagged for sexual content and violence. There are three options for each aspect:\n\n- Sexual Content: [Safe](#1.1), [Suggestive](#1.2) and [Explicit](#1.3).\n- Violence: [Tame](#2.1), [Violent](#2.2) and [Brutal](#2.3).\n\nDetailed guidelines for these options are listed below.\n\nThe rating should be based solely on the graphical aspects of the image. Any text in the image has no bearing on its rating, even if the text contains offensive or suggestive language.\n\nEven with these guidelines it may not always be easy to determine the rating of an image. When in doubt, it's often best to choose the more conservative option.\n\n# Sexual Content\n\n## Safe\n\nImages flagged as "safe" in terms of sexual content do not depict anything sexualised. Obviously nothing explicitly sexual belongs here, even if there is no nudity involved. The only thing that could be fine is not mouth-to-mouth kissing, as long as it is performed by fully dressed individuals.\n\nIn terms of clothes, fully visible underwear, especially if the image focuses on it, should be flagged as suggestive in and of themselves. Other clothes are safe as long as they are not see-through, torn in inappropriate places or so skin tight that you can easily see every little curve under them.\n\nExamples:\n\n- [Safe,Tame](https://s2.vndb.org/sf/15/25415.jpg) - Fully clothed, no hint of any sexual actions.\n- [Safe,Tame](https://s2.vndb.org/ch/59/72259.jpg) - Male upper body nudity is "safe", unless the character is touching someone erotically or posing in a suggestive manner. In case when it's impossible to tell from the picture alone if the character is female or a feminine-looking male, assume a more conservative position and treat the character as female.\n- [Safe,Tame](https://s2.vndb.org/sf/57/26357.jpg) - Obviously images without any people in them whatsoever are always sexually safe, unless they depict outright sextoys.\n- [Safe,Tame](https://s2.vndb.org/sf/56/133456.jpg) - Both characters are fully clothed and the peck on the forehead is very much safe.\n- [Safe,Tame](https://s2.vndb.org/sf/01/6901.jpg) - Front covering swimsuits (including the school swimsuits in two parts, and normal full cup bikinis) should be considered safe, unless they are stretched by visibly erect nipples. However, micro-bikinis and sling bikinis that only cover the areola should fall under "suggestive".\n- [Safe,Tame](https://s2.vndb.org/sf/07/75007.jpg) - Wearing a bath towel that covers everything without showing implicit anatomy, should be treated the same as wearing a swimsuit and be "safe".\n\nCounter-examples:\n\n- [Suggestive,Tame](https://s2.vndb.org/sf/57/133457.jpg) - Both characters are fully clothed, but "proper", mouth-to-mouth kissing should be flagged as suggestive.\n- [Suggestive,Tame](https://s2.vndb.org/cv/51/20751.jpg) - Male upper body nudity becomes "suggestive" if the character is touching someone erotically or posing in a suggestive manner.\n- [Suggestive,Tame](https://s2.vndb.org/sf/58/133458.jpg) - Fully visible underwear is always "suggestive" at least, no exceptions.\n- [Suggestive,Tame](https://s2.vndb.org/sf/14/126614.jpg) - Micro-bikinis and sling bikinis should fall under "suggestive", regardless if they are stretched by pronounced nipples.\n- [Suggestive,Tame](https://s2.vndb.org/sf/59/133459.jpg) - See-through clothes (regardless whether they are like that by design or because they are wet like in this example) that allows underwear / naked body to be seen is always at least suggestive.\n- [Suggestive,Tame](https://s2.vndb.org/sf/60/133460.jpg) - Even if the character is fully dressed, the image can be still not safe if it is eroticised in some way. In this case the condom in her mouth makes this suggestive, without that the image would be safe.\n\n## Suggestive\n\nSuggestive images are in some way sexualised, however they are not enough to be called outright pornographic.\n\nIn terms of action this can mean "proper" mouth-to-mouth kissing, posing in a clearly suggestive, erotic manner, mimicking sexual acts, having sextoys in the background and so on. Any form of penetrative sex should be flagged as explicit, even if the image does not involve full nudity.\n\nClothing-wise anything goes as long genitals, and for female characters, nipples are not shown naked. Skimpy outfits, bondage gear, even "ecchi style" full nudity: like taking a bath while a strategically placed mist hiding the naughty bits.\n\nExamples:\n\n- [Suggestive,Tame](https://s2.vndb.org/sf/57/133457.jpg) - Even though both characters are fully clothed, mouth-to-mouth kissing makes the image suggestive.\n- [Suggestive,Tame](https://s2.vndb.org/sf/59/133459.jpg) - See-through clothes (regardless whether they are like that by design or because they are wet like in this example) that allows underwear / naked body to be seen is always at least suggestive.\n- [Suggestive,Tame](https://s2.vndb.org/sf/60/133460.jpg) - Even if the character is fully dressed, the image can be still not safe if it is eroticised in some way. In this case the condom in her mouth makes this suggestive, without that the image would be safe.\n- [Suggestive,Tame](https://s2.vndb.org/ch/90/53590.jpg) - If the character has erect nipples that visibly stretch the material of their clothing, then it falls under "suggestive". It applies, even if the clothing itself would not be considered skimpy.\n- [Suggestive,Tame](https://s2.vndb.org/sf/14/126614.jpg) - Micro-bikinis and sling bikinis should fall under "suggestive", regardless if they are stretched by pronounced nipples.\n- [Suggestive,Tame](https://s2.vndb.org/sf/32/88632.jpg) - Even if the character is wearing a clothing that would be considered safe under normal circumstances and is not posing in a suggestive manner, the image can still be considered "suggestive" if the camera unduly focuses on the character's sexual attributes\n- [Suggestive,Tame](https://s2.vndb.org/sf/58/133458.jpg) - Fully visible underwear is always "suggestive" at least, no exceptions.\n- [Suggestive,Tame](https://s2.vndb.org/sf/61/133461.jpg) - Full nudity in and of itself is normally explicit, but if it is framed in a way where female nipples and genitals of any kind are not actually visible, it should be flagged as suggestive instead.\n- [Suggestive,Tame](https://s2.vndb.org/sf/62/133462.jpg) - Kinky outfits and bondage is always at least suggestive.\n- [Suggestive,Tame](https://s2.vndb.org/sf/63/133463.jpg) - The very presence of sextoys makes any image at least suggestive, provided that they are not actually in use. Actively using sextoys is always explicit.\n\nCounter-examples:\n\n- [Safe,Tame](https://s2.vndb.org/sf/56/133456.jpg) - Both characters are fully clothed and the peck on the forehead is very much safe.\n- [Safe,Tame](https://s2.vndb.org/sf/91/35091.jpg) - Erect nipples that only mildly stretch the material can still be considered "safe", in case of the image lacking any other suggestive elements\n- [Explicit,Tame](https://s2.vndb.org/sf/64/133464.jpg) - No sexual acts, but the visible, naked nipples still upgrades this image from suggestive to explicit.\n- [Explicit,Tame](https://s2.vndb.org/sf/65/133465.jpg) - Active use of vibrators makes this explicit, even without any nudity.\n- [Explicit,Tame](https://s2.vndb.org/sf/66/133466.jpg) - Similarly, penetrative sex is always explicit, regardless of nudity.\n\n## Explicit\n\nExplicit images are the ones that could be easily considered pornographic in their content. Performing any and all sexual acts that involve genitals or penetration goes here, regardless how well dressed the characters doing them are.\n\nThe lack of clothing alone can only make an image explicit if it shows naked female nipples or naked genitalia (as a general rule of thumb: if the latter is exposed enough to be hit by the Japanese mosaic censorship, it's explicit).\n\nExamples:\n\n- [Explicit,Tame](https://s2.vndb.org/sf/67/133467.jpg) - Full frontal nudity is always explicit, regardless if the situation itself is sexual or not.\n- [Explicit,Tame](https://s2.vndb.org/sf/68/133468.jpg) - Having sex in the nude is blatantly obviously explicit, no matter what.\n- [Explicit,Tame](https://s2.vndb.org/sf/64/133464.jpg) - No sexual acts, but the visible, naked nipples still upgrades this image from suggestive to explicit.\n- [Explicit,Tame](https://s2.vndb.org/sf/65/133465.jpg) - Active use of vibrators makes this explicit, even without any nudity.\n- [Explicit,Tame](https://s2.vndb.org/sf/66/133466.jpg) - Similarly, penetrative and non-penetrative sexual activities are always explicit, regardless of nudity.\n- [Explicit,Tame](https://s2.vndb.org/sf/35/10535.jpg) - The presence of sexual fluids (most commonly semen) turns the pictures "explicit", even if they would otherwise be "safe" or "suggestive".\n\nCounter-examples\n\n- [Suggestive,Tame](https://s2.vndb.org/sf/61/133461.jpg) - Full nudity in and of itself is normally explicit, but if it is framed in a way where female nipples and genitals of any kind are not actually visible, it should be flagged as suggestive instead.\n- [Suggestive,Tame](https://s2.vndb.org/sf/62/133462.jpg) - Kinky outfits and bondage is always at least suggestive, but they are only explicit if they are used as part of a sex scene or if they leave either the genitals or female nipples visible.\n- [Suggestive,Tame](https://s2.vndb.org/sf/63/133463.jpg) - The very presence of sextoys makes any image at least suggestive, provided that they are not actually in use. Actively using sextoys is necessary though for this alone to make the image explicit.\n\n# Violence\n\n## Tame\n\nImages flagged with "tame" either contains no violence whatsoever or it is very mild. Namely:\n\n- Tame slapstick comedy (tsundere heroine slapping male love interest, guy flicking the forehead of heroine, most chibi slapstick comedy, it only becomes more than tame once this involves serious injuries or worse, basically when it enters black comedy territories).\n- Character brandishing a weapon, but said weapon is not actually hurting anyone in the image.\n- Very minor bruises or cuts in an otherwise non-violent context (like clumsy heroine cutting her finger with a knife where a single drop of blood shows up before getting a bandaid on it).\n- A character losing her virginity, which is portrayed by adding a trickle of blood (whether it is consensual or not is of no import).\n- Friendly slaps and punches that aren't meant to seriously harm (nor do they actually seriously harm) the receiver.\n\nAside of the minor bruise example above, anything that draws blood or leaves a swelled up bruise belongs under "Violent". Obviously dead bodies also should be flagged at least as "Violent". Any example of torture, even if it draws no blood, is not "Tame". Images that otherwise would be tame, but show non-comedic depictions of criminal activity against someone well being (e.g. kidnapping, poisoning, drugging), become "Violent". Characters actively fighting in a non-comedic manner is also at least "Violent".\n\nExamples:\n\n- [Safe,Tame](https://s2.vndb.org/sf/70/56370.jpg) - Perfectly violence free image, so it belongs under "Tame".\n- [Explicit,Tame](https://s2.vndb.org/sf/69/84969.jpg) - Sexual content flags are completely separate from violence flags: a sexually explicit image can very easily be "Tame".\n- [Safe,Tame](https://s2.vndb.org/sf/72/56372.jpg) - The character brandishes a weapon, but it is not actively used to VISIBLY harm anyone, so it's tame.\n- [Safe,Tame](https://s2.vndb.org/sf/17/13917.jpg) - Clear cut case of comedic violence, tame.\n- [Safe,Tame](https://s2.vndb.org/sf/31/133631.jpg) - Minor bruises in an otherwise non-violent environment.\n- [Explicit,Tame](https://s2.vndb.org/sf/31/1931.jpg) - A loss of virginity, accompanied by blood.\n- [Safe,Tame](https://s2.vndb.org/sf/34/133634.jpg) - Characters taking up a fighting stance, but not actually engaging in a fight (yet) is considered tame.\n- [Explicit,Tame](https://s2.vndb.org/sf/36/133636.jpg) - The mere presence of a weapon is NOT enough for an image to be violent, so this image is tame. And again, nudity has no bearing on the violence scale.\n\nCounter-examples:\n\n- [Safe,Violent](https://s2.vndb.org/sf/75/56375.jpg) - Obvious kidnapping attempt, not tame.\n- [Safe,Violent](https://s2.vndb.org/sf/30/133630.jpg) - Being drugged is not tame.\n- [Suggestive,Violent](https://s2.vndb.org/sf/32/133632.jpg) - Separately the character being armed and ready for a fight AND the small cut on her arm would be tame, but the two together is not.\n- [Safe,Violent](https://s2.vndb.org/sf/33/133633.jpg) - An actual, non-comedic fight scene with physical contact belongs at least under "Violent", even if no blood is drawn.\n- [Safe,Violent](https://s2.vndb.org/sf/35/133635.jpg) - A bloodied weapon, even if the source of the blood is not visible, is at least violent.\n\n## Violent\n\nViolent images can be violent mostly based on either the presence of blood (beyond the limitations for tame images above) or non-comedic, active fight scenes. These two aspects are the major contributors to flagging an image as "Violent", but there are some additional cases as well: physically harmful criminal activity against someone is in general also belongs here: kidnapping, drugging, torturing, etc. And finally BDSM sadomasochistic acts belong here, as long as they are heavy enough to leave a mark. A light slap on the ass is tame, but if it's enough to leave a red hand mark on said ass, it should not be flagged as tame. dedicated spanking session (like the spanked character is tied down with their ass being slapped or spread out over the knees of another character who spanks them) should not be tame, unless it's a clear example of comedy violence. Whipping, caning, flogging, wax play, ryona, wooden horse, breast press and so on all belong here. Bondage in and of itself should be considered tame however.\n\nGenerally the upper limit for this flag is excessive blood, gore and snuff. Those should be flagged as a "Brutal" instead.\n\nDue to how difficult it is to judge consensuality through images alone, rape and other forms of non-consensual sexual activity should not be flagged as "violent" by themselves, unless other actions that would be considered "violent", even without the presence of sexual content, are portrayed in the image (e.g. rapist slapping his victim).\n\nExamples:\n\n- [Safe,Violent](https://s2.vndb.org/sf/75/56375.jpg) - Obvious kidnapping attempt.\n- [Safe,Violent](https://s2.vndb.org/sf/30/133630.jpg) - Being drugged belongs under the "Violent" flag\n- [Suggestive,Violent](https://s2.vndb.org/sf/32/133632.jpg) - Separately the character being armed and ready for a fight AND the small cut on her arm would be tame, but the two together is not.\n- [Safe,Violent](https://s2.vndb.org/sf/33/133633.jpg) - An actual, non-comedic fight scene with physical contact belongs at least under "Violent", even if no blood is drawn.\n- [Safe,Violent](https://s2.vndb.org/sf/35/133635.jpg) - A bloodied weapon, even if the source of the blood is not visible, is at least violent.\n- [Safe,Violent](https://s2.vndb.org/sf/42/56342.jpg) - Dead body is only a "violent" image if the character has not experienced grievous bodily harm, mutilation or perverse desecration, or if the particular details cannot be seen. Bodies fully decomposed to skeletons are always only "violent".\n- [Safe,Violent](https://s2.vndb.org/sf/35/115035.jpg) - Torture is always at least violent, even if no blood is drawn.\n- [Explicit,Violent](https://s2.vndb.org/sf/89/70289.jpg) - Ryona is torture, and as such it is at least violent, possibly brutal if it gets to borderline guro territories.\n- [Explicit,Violent](https://s2.vndb.org/sf/37/133637.jpg) - Spanking with visible hand-marks.\n- [Suggestive,Violent](https://s2.vndb.org/sf/39/133639.jpg) - Dedicated OTK spanking session. Even though the reddening is not visible, it's still more than just some light slaps at the heat of the moment, so it is considered violent.\n- [Explicit,Violent](https://s2.vndb.org/sf/40/133640.jpg) - Wax play and other hardcore sadomasochistic BDSM practices are all to be flagged as violent.\n\nCounter-examples: \n\n- [Safe,Tame](https://s2.vndb.org/sf/38/133638.jpg) - Spanking, but it's clearly played for comedy, as such it is tame.\n- [Explicit,Brutal](https://s2.vndb.org/sf/41/133641.jpg) - Excessive blood or visible grievous bodily harm are both enough to make an image brutal on their own, this image has both.\n- [Safe,Tame](https://s2.vndb.org/sf/72/56372.jpg) - The character brandishes a weapon, but it is not actively used to VISIBLY harm anyone, so it's tame.\n- [Safe,Tame](https://s2.vndb.org/sf/17/13917.jpg) - Clear cut case of comedic violence, tame.\n- [Safe,Tame](https://s2.vndb.org/sf/31/133631.jpg) - Minor bruises in an otherwise non-violent environment, tame.\n- [Safe,Tame](https://s2.vndb.org/sf/34/133634.jpg) - Characters taking up a fighting stance, but not actually engaging in a fight (yet) is considered tame.\n- [Explicit,Tame](https://s2.vndb.org/sf/36/133636.jpg) - The mere presence of a weapon is NOT enough for an image to be violent, so this image is tame. And again, nudity has no bearing on the violence scale.\n\n## Brutal\n\nBrutal images push violence to the limit. Images belonging here feature an excessive amount of blood, characters being tortured to death, limbs (or other body parts) chopped off, bodies being gutted out, corpses torn apart, eyes being scraped out and so on. Generally the violence in these images are either impossible to survive or at the very minimum would cause irreversible, crippling damage. \n\nExamples:\n\n- [Explicit,Brutal](https://s2.vndb.org/sf/41/133641.jpg) - Excessive blood or visible grievous bodily harm are both enough to make an image brutal on their own, this image has both.\n- [Explicit,Brutal](https://s2.vndb.org/sf/42/133642.jpg) - Executions, eroticised or not, are always brutal.\n- [Suggestive,Brutal](https://s2.vndb.org/sf/43/133643.jpg) - Chopping off limbs on screen is always brutal.\n- [Safe,Brutal](https://s2.vndb.org/sf/90/131990.jpg) - Even if the act itself is not on screen, if the fresh, bloody result is (like a bloody, empty eye socket in our example), it still considered brutal.\n- [Explicit,Brutal](https://s2.vndb.org/sf/44/133644.jpg) - Being tortured to death (regardless whether it is an intentionally brutal execution or the torturer overdoing it), is always brutal.\n- [Explicit,Brutal](https://s2.vndb.org/sf/45/133645.jpg) - [Guro](/g162) is always brutal.\n\nCounter-examples:\n\n- [Safe,Violent](https://s2.vndb.org/sf/35/115035.jpg) - Torture is violent, but  it only becomes brutal if excessive blood is involved (we are talking about a literal pool of it) or it causes permanent, crippling harm.\n- [Explicit,Violent](https://s2.vndb.org/sf/89/70289.jpg) - Ryona is only brutal if it gets to borderline guro territories. "Just" beating someone like in the image is "only" violent.\n- [Safe,Violent](https://s2.vndb.org/sf/46/133646.jpg) - Implied death, where the body is not or only partially shown to the point that death cannot be ascertained without context is violent, not brutal.\n- [Suggestive,Violent](https://s2.vndb.org/sf/48/127048.jpg) - Even if the text describes details that would be considered "brutal", the image is still "violent" if the described details cannot be clearly seen.\n- [Safe,Tame](https://s2.vndb.org/sf/47/133647.jpg) - While the process of amputation is brutal, actual amputees in a non-violent context, where the amputation wound is not open or bleeding, are actually tame and do not trigger either the "Brutal" or even the "Violent" flags.
d20	Scratchpad	This page is a scratchpad/sandbox to be used by VNDB moderators for drafting guidelines before they are moved to the proper pages, keeping track of proposals and tasks and whatever else may be useful but doesn't quite fit on one the existing pages.\n\n###d2: Adding/Editing a Visual Novel\n\n# Screenshots\n\n- At least half of the images should be actual screenshots of the game. That is, they should include character sprites or some form of dialog or user interface. Plain event CG images without any text or interfaces are allowed to demonstrate the drawing style, but should not dominate over the other screenshots. Screenshots showing menus, UI and title screens without sprites, background, CG, gameplay or choices are also allowed if they are kept to a minimum; preferably 2 or less, and these can be replaced at any time. (https://vndb.org/t20768) \n\n- Do not post different language versions or different drawing styles of the same screenshot, this is not a comparison gallery. (https://vndb.org/v67/)\n\n- Do not upload screenshots from non-edited MTL versions, even official ones. Screenshots from English edited machine translations are allowed, but keep in mind these can be replaced at any time with other screenshots, even if they are in a different language. Do not replace existing screenshots with ones from MTL, official or not. (https://vndb.org/t20800.2)\n\n- In contrast with PC screenshots, mobile and console editions do not have a specific resolution requirement. However, there are still some rules when uploading from those platforms: (https://vndb.org/t20835)\n\n. Screenshots should not be resized.\n\n. Screenshots based on the console or mobile resolution screen (?) (I don't know how console resolution works) are allowed. However, if known, the native resolution is still preferred if the user has the capability to take such screenshots.\n\n. For emulators, while screenshots with graphical enhancements/mods are allowed, it's still preferred to take screenshots in the original console resolution or the game's native resolution, using the least amount of graphical improvements.\n\n###d3: Adding/Editing a Release\n\n# DLCs\n\nDLC (Downloadable Content) is is a game addon that requires the presence of the base game in order to install and play.\n\nSome DLCs add new content to the existing story (e.g. new routes, post-game epilogues, etc.), while others are self-contained separate stories.\n\n- All DLCs should be marked as patches, as they require the base game to play them. Software that is erroneously labeled as DLC by the publisher, but does not require the base game to play shouldn't be treated as a DLC but rather as a normal release entry.\n- The DLCs that add content to the existing game should be put as releases under that game's VN entry and should be labeled 'partial'.<br>\n- The DLCs that are self-contained stories should have their own VN entries instead and should be labeled 'complete'.<br>\n- Uncensored patches should not be treated as DLCs, despite sometimes being labeled as such by the publisher. They should be put under the main VN entry and be labeled 'complete' if they restore all of the censored content, and 'partial' if only part of the censored content has been restored.\n\n# Images\n## Digital promo art\n- Images with only the logo are not allowed unless is the only available image for that entry.\n- Cases when a single promotional art should be added:\n\n  - When the only difference is the position or size of the logo. ([r104897.4](https://vndb.org/r104897.4), [r78903.30](https://vndb.org/r78903.30))\n  - When the only difference is the size or resolution. In some cases it may appear that image is cropped, zoomed or characters were accommodated or removed in accordance with the smaller space ([r59804.17](https://vndb.org/r59804.17), [r118486.6](https://vndb.org/r118486.6)). In this case, use the image that shows the highest amount of details or the image that has all characters shown.\n  - Mirrored images without any other significant changes ([r103837.14](https://vndb.org/r103837.14)).\n  - A promotional art with a logo and another one without it. In this case, the image with the logo should be used.\n  - Promotional art that only contains the logo and nothing else ([r53689.18](https://vndb.org/r53689.18), [r122944.1](https://vndb.org/r122944.1)). In this case, the image with art+logo should be used.\n  - Any combination of the above. ([r70161.13](https://vndb.org/r70161.13), [r74586.14](https://vndb.org/r74586.14))\n\n- Cases when more than one single promotional art can be added:\n\n  - Images with the same background or character, but with a different logo. ([r63719](https://vndb.org/r63719), [r66321](https://vndb.org/r66321))\n  - Images with the same background or logo but different characters.\n  - Images with the same background, logo and characters, but with different clothes, objects or groups of characters.\n  - Images with the same logo and characters but with a different background.\n  - Different images from a single website or store. ([r105206](https://vndb.org/r105206), [r109906](https://vndb.org/r109906))\n  - If the art and the logo are separated. In this case, both images can be added. ([Example](https://store-jp.nintendo.com/dw/image/v2/BFGJ_PRD/on/demandware.static/-/Sites-all-master-catalog/ja_JP/dw5f4677c0/products/D70010000060822/heroBanner/1aaa345c279c423008c2799abfd8752c0066a03b651d9a28ad563447ce9d26b4.jpg)) However, this should only be applied to releases without a "proper" cover art, even from other websites or stores.\n\nMaybe apply all this between releases too?
