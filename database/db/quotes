2	v9847	\N	3	That's right. Girls aren't just breasts.
3	v18807	\N	1	There's currently a definite warm atmosphere enveloping this house. However, that may have something to do with the stewing hot-pot.

30	v22230	\N	10	I still haven't forgotten the last time you tried to sweet-talk me like this. I ended up having to molest Shikibe-senpai's naked body in the girl's bath.
31	v12402	\N	8	Please, do not let go of my hand.
32	v617	\N	4	Good, good, just as I planned. We creatures known as 'men' are meant to be paired with cute girls.
33	v264	\N	7	You call me 'oniichan', but we're in love. That kind of thing normally only happens in erotic games.
34	v6245	c9782	3	If you abuse machines, they will rebel one day. And you'll be targeted, Stacy Connor. Be careful.
35	v16208	\N	4	...The way I'm feeling right now, I could definitely murder you quite passionately if I went back in time this very instant.
36	v9124	\N	1	Alright, then I'm a groper!
37	v210	\N	4	The more concealed knives a man has, the stronger he is.
38	v13912	\N	3	Until today I'd always assassinated people who called me flat, but now I understand there was no need for me to do something so silly!

54	v3139	\N	3	Diet!? You are an android so you won't get fat no matter how much you eat.
55	v1377	\N	7	We're just adding "theft" to the list of "intrusion" and "damage to property." So long as we don't kill anyone, it'll be the same whatever we do.
56	v19655	\N	3	Fine then! I accept your challenge. I'll show you the table manners I learned in my imaginary French restaurant. I fix my imaginary neck tie.
57	v1377	\N	4	You know what they say. "Laughter is a lubricant for the soul."
58	v5	c1864	9	So because it's so fraught with danger that even the Earth might be destroyed, we should abstain from cleaning.
59	v12246	\N	6	I'm a virgin. Nice to meet you.

66	v751	\N	9	...pleased to meet you. Try not to talk to me.
67	v7402	\N	7	All of your choices are meaningless
68	v12849	\N	16	Senpai... I hate to break it to you, but boobs don't talk.
69	v1388	\N	4	So the truth isn't really that painful, no. It just happens to be a bitch.
70	v7184	\N	5	If A=B and B=C, then A would have to be equal to C till the ends of time, no buts about it.
71	v3161	\N	2	Since when was sex an act of deepening trust? I think she watches too many spy movies.

82	v17287	\N	6	...I've never spent such a long time with one woman before.
83	v7723	\N	8	Good, now you're drunk! No problem now! Go ahead and have sex!

88	v6572	\N	6	The birth of a new magical girl! It's soooo less messy than regular birth...!
89	v21289	\N	4	One ton per sheep? Just how many month's worth of shit is that?
90	v922	\N	1	I-I'm cute even when I cry.
91	v7382	\N	4	It's said that love is the most powerful force in the universe. I am attempting to harness that power to create weapons of mass destruction.
92	v13046	\N	2	It's sure to be recording when there's a "dabaa" moment, an "unyaa" moment - and there's no way I'd miss a classic "mufufu" moment.
93	v9124	c6967	7	What does having black tea as your special move even mean?
94	v31064	\N	6	Oh yeah. She got hit by a bus.
95	v5871	\N	4	I'm a proud siscon!
96	v648	\N	3	I'm talking about the traits of a main character! Or are you a girl?
97	v16743	c35280	8	To ensure safe sexual practice, Lucy wanted to let master know that an age verification is required before any further physical intimacy is allowed...
98	v15708	\N	3	Chief, what's the problem with a ghost or two... more importantly, let's get to drinking already.
99	v1388	\N	5	Hey, I boil the pasta, that counts as cooking.
100	v12849	c22771	15	She's starting out with a bow to my dick.
101	v10608	\N	8	I also think it's normal to get possessive around aggressive polyamorous sperm pirates.
102	v264	\N	7	This is my second bedroom -- I mean, my classroom.
103	v16044	\N	3	Having something you love but being forced to only ever look at it without even being able to touch it sounds like torture.
104	v7721	\N	2	A gust of wind at the worst time could be all it takes to end someone's life.
105	v3249	\N	1	Ah, useless. It's all useless.
106	v914	\N	11	Have you ever cried at night, thinking about boobs that wither away without being seen by people?
108	v812	\N	3	Master... am I doing well as your dog?

110	v1392	\N	6	What's the meaning of seeing panties in one's last moments...am I going to Heaven or Hell?

112	v238	\N	3	Arawn-sama......hurt me more....... 
113	v19073	c49563	10	First I pulled out a legendary sword, then I met a ghost girl, then I got engaged, and now I met a ninja.
114	v46744	\N	3	Why are you embarassed by your own sister's words? Being a siscon is a crime, you know?
115	v19444	\N	5	Eroge? You mean those Chinese porn powerpoints for dudes?
116	v12246	\N	5	My hobby is smearing butter all over my body and letting a dog lick it.
117	v2747	\N	5	Girls are angels. Angels take dogs and boys away to the heaven. Sad. It's so sad.
119	v417	\N	7	...you seem to have patented being one step behind.
120	v26765	\N	7	I appear to have spawned a child.
121	v7679	\N	8	Rule breakers will be shot to death... That's just common sense!
122	v19431	\N	1	This is my story. Sending with love, from me to everyone involved with me. The one and only story, that spells our living proof.
124	v25366	\N	6	How could i even think of marriage when the only part of 'Love' i've ever gotten is the 'L'!?
125	v57	\N	6	Oh well. The more tsun she is now, the more dere she'll be later.
126	v1660	\N	8	All men want the women they love to urinate on their faces.
127	v22658	c85083	4	What? We were talking about things to look forward to at Christmas, right? And the only thing Christmas is really good for is a good lay.
128	v24	\N	3	This is my truth!
129	v12849	c22775	3	You totally did! Being dense is a sin, Hinata-kun.
130	v7014	\N	13	Siiiigh... I guess that means nobody's gonna die! Laaaame...
131	v492	\N	2	To my regret resolution is too low... looks like it's covered with mosaics, though that is erotic in its own way too
132	v436	\N	1	Nice to meet you, filthy humans.
133	v1377	\N	4	You know, I've suddenly woken up to my natural obligation to leave behind offspring.
134	v9880	\N	3	My penis is mine!
136	v5871	\N	1	Well, it's true after all; I am pretty annoying. Ehe~
137	v1388	\N	2	And look -- I spent the entire night fucking your brains out, just in case you don't remember. There isn't much to be embarrassed about at this point.
138	v231	\N	4	It'll take more than these wounds to take me down! I drink milk every day, after all!
139	v5154	\N	5	Eh? What? So every one of us is a virgin? That's sad!
140	v28576	\N	1	Vegetables? I tend to not eat any. I feel like they would turn my insides green and make me unhealthy.
141	v431	\N	3	May I touch your "Sexual Intercourse Function"?
142	v7707	\N	1	In a gal game, sincerely aiming at the heroine you choose is the accepted practice, the dogma, it's mandatory.
143	v6572	\N	2	He's a slave, Sena! A slave to jiggle!
144	v50	\N	1	Because you said 'brownie', I was wondering if you meant Emiya-kun was like a choco-chip cake.
146	v382	c4655	6	I, it,it IT'S A FLAAAAAAGGGGG!1!1!
147	v18760	\N	1	Like hell I'd be a friend with a pig like that.
148	v10304	\N	3	Asaba-sensei, I don't think you should run in the hallway.
149	v5657	\N	1	When on duty, work hard. When on break, rest hard.
151	v5943	\N	3	Her tsundere ratio is 8:2. So don't think you could see her dere side so easily.
153	v2002	\N	9	I'm not talking to myself! Can't you see? I'm talking to the guy on the other side of the monitor.
154	v32333	\N	5	** USER WAS BANNED FOR THIS POST **
156	v581	\N	3	You go first. As a moe-type-character you can't move fast anyway.
157	v18781	\N	1	It's not an exaggeration to say that my idea of a family is a harem.
158	v21465	\N	6	Then I'll also give you the curse of anything you get going on sale right after you buy it!
159	v5154	\N	15	When I was in America, I managed all my conversations with just "thank you", "dog" and "pencil"!
160	v12849	c22768	20	I'm not! My heart doesn't have the processing power to deal with so many inputs at once. Even running Windows 95 on this baby would be questionable.
161	v19654	\N	4	The forty days I spent in your pocket were the most exciting days of my life.
162	v7679	\N	7	Well, the world is shaped by the will of the majority... It makes sense that it bends to those who lack talent.
163	v14269	c17415	3	Haha! I've mastered Aomori, Kouchi, and Fukuoka, too! I'm practically multilingual.
165	v18567	\N	1	Th-That's not fair! I'm sorry if I treated you kinda bad, but why does Syrup get to eat you and I can't?!
166	v7014	\N	3	A teleporting, weaponized, ninja teddy bear... I'm not sure if that's supposed to be scary or silly.
167	v6458	\N	1	Really? If you're lying, then just be honest with us...
168	v2342	\N	6	Listen well, Yukinojou! If it seems you're about to lose, then just bite your opponent's ears off! It's not a fault if the referee won't notice it!
170	v11	\N	61	People die when they are killed.
171	v812	\N	7	P-Please don't needlessly remember my masturbation cycle
172	v3161	c33085	4	Funny how so many things come up when all you want to do is pee.
173	v8158	\N	3	Making a resistant girl do what she doesn't want to feels way better than it should!
174	v3336	\N	1	Whoa! A talking doll!
175	v23908	\N	5	Tell them you were jerking off in the classroom-- it's probably better than saying you were getting sucked off by your little sister.
176	v17018	\N	5	Unless it's bad news, I won't hear it.
177	v21261	\N	4	You're not a proper game developer until you have crossdressed at least once!
178	v17	c28	4	I am...You!
181	v22230	c66155	14	It's easy enough to compare boob size with other girls, but yeah, nobody's really gonna be comparing the size of their holes.
182	v32333	\N	3	The first thing you should know about being a writer is that it will turn you into a person who will find every excuse not to write.
183	v4037	\N	5	Here. My mouth is your toilet.
184	v20	c15061	3	I tried hard to forget something and, it actually worked? I must be genius.
185	v20538	\N	1	I-I see death hasn't made you any less flippant.
186	v16208	\N	4	God, how omnipotent can maids actually be?
187	v4028	\N	6	Naturally, my hands got sticky from the oil... but I'm a man and therefore don't care!
188	v914	\N	9	Let's see. Touching a girl's boobs is extremely comforting in any situation.
189	v12849	c27673	3	Not quite. Anyone who can grow from believing they're a genius... is a genius.
190	v16044	c26597	14	Please watch me pleasure myself!
191	v18498	c40664	1	That old man... Is wiping his ass more important than saving the world?
192	v9124	\N	4	Today's Monday, after all. Why wouldn't I be in high spirits at the start of the week?
193	v5154	\N	5	While masticating steadily away, I ponder a certain philosophical dilemma. --Do beans have emotions?
194	v3161	\N	2	I didn't want him to go to waste though so I had him stuffed and used him to decorate my living room.
195	v44	\N	2	Y, you... Don't create such a painful event in the morning, you sister-character!
196	v13839	\N	2	I thought the mating season for succubi was year-round...
197	v7689	\N	4	Especially, tears are unnecessary for eroge. Nakige are not suited for men. They are created by gays, bought by gays, gay games.
198	v1311	\N	2	I'll tear this filthy world apart...with my own two hands! NO ONE WILL ESCAPE JUDGMENT!
200	v914	\N	9	My early ejaculation is awesome at a time like this.
201	v67	\N	6	How would you react to my flat breasts?
202	v1414	\N	4	There are no clothes left I could take off.
203	v16560	\N	3	Please stop your serious monologing while having my head in an armlock.
204	v12561	\N	1	What are you saying?! Isn't your very existence linked to sexual harassment?!
205	v1143	\N	13	Later on, this abnormal incident was shrugged off by NASA with, "Oh, so it's just Momoyo".
206	v44	\N	8	Good man! Now hurry up and put your semen into my anus.
207	v18760	c41749	4	He repeated the same line twice and patted me on the buttocks in a friendly gesture.
208	v6245	c8346	5	Fuhahaha, Class Rep is embarrassing. Just call me The King.
209	v5871	\N	2	There are really only a few scenes like that! So there's not even that much ecchi!
210	v44	\N	8	You are an uncute, uncharming, unsexy, titless little sister!
211	v11856	\N	5	Phew, she didn't notice the two hour extended edition of Adult's in Diapers: Fetish Play next to it.
212	v938	\N	2	Unable to control our passion, we'll do "synchronized swimming of love" in the locker room!
213	v10665	\N	1	Y'know, they say that ladies love a domesticated man.
214	v74	\N	4	Now then, let's go. To the holy land of bentos, the rooftop! A chilly yet hot time is awaiting us!
215	v14269	c17418	2	Is this what I think it is?! Are you going to shame my body by saying terrible things like I'm too small to even see?!
216	v2632	\N	8	Heh, sorry. It's just that when I see dat ass o' yours, I start to drooooool...
218	v18152	\N	8	God said: anything tastes great when there's bacon in it.
219	v2790	\N	1	I feel like something really inappropriate was erected. Is it just my imagination?
220	v414	\N	2	Aki, you sound so nice today. Are you okay?
221	v2002	\N	7	...let's stop thinking nostalgically about the future.
222	v1027	\N	2	Thus, I deny tomorrow.
223	v4	\N	9	That's right...We were always together...In this world. In this sad, lonely world
224	v812	\N	4	Don't emit your host beam since it is perverted!
225	v12402	\N	11	Twelve, as of today. Practically an adult. I was knee-deep in dick at that age.
226	v231	\N	9	I can't believe you pissed all over the cockpit! What are we supposed to do if you ruined any of the instruments?
227	v1027	\N	4	Do not gather. Do not form herds. That does nothing but rob you of intelligence......
228	v71	\N	3	Woojoo ryke-a kupp obb kowfee?
229	v46744	\N	4	Numbers never lie. So if I measure your penis length, I can your body condition that day.
230	v4028	c5010	2	I'm not talking about liking or disliking! Sweets are justice! Justice, I tell you!
231	v4017	c19161	4	Just you watch boy, girlfriends don't just grow on trees!
233	v6710	\N	5	If a man looks at you too much, it makes a baby inside you!
234	v15077	c21328	8	Yeah. Everyone gets an urge to pour ethanol onto a fire once in a while...
236	v103	\N	2	...and what are you going to do? Rape me?
237	v12	\N	6	It's summer vacation. What else is there to do other than going to the dungeon?
238	v7679	\N	12	Obsessing over stuff doesn't solve anything, right? Yep, I should stop thinking and play video games.
239	v238	\N	2	Look, what's mine is mine, and what's yours is also all mine!
240	v12607	\N	1	Farewell, big hard cock...
241	v155	\N	6	Sawamura Tsukasa, I hereby forbid you from breathing within these premises.
242	v3161	c33085	1	I'm not crazy about the idea of jamming a needle into my own balls.
244	v7771	\N	17	If you do your absolute best and things still don't work out, then I'll become your mom, Haruki-kun.

253	v3161	\N	3	Whoever said that women don't have smelly farts must have never had one fart right in their face. It's not pleasant.

255	v8158	c9359	1	I believe someone with your talent only comes around once every six months or so.

260	v599	\N	3	Of course she's wearing clothes, but to me those are the ribbons of eros!
261	v3161	\N	1	I need to ask. Are you by any chance... sexually frustrated?

272	v18760	c41751	3	I really can't tell. I might just throw them away after giving birth if they're too annoying.
273	v1143	\N	3	Uuu... yaaay! I'm a carnival of innocence! Hooray for sunny skies! Japan, cha-cha-cha!
274	v324	\N	4	Praying is futile. Because in this world we live in————God doesn't exist.
275	v46744	\N	1	Incest is bad, Onii-chan.
276	v19769	\N	4	Hey! Don't ignore me! Please, at least give me a retort!
277	v12402	\N	7	But hope has a way of forsaking those who give it a home.

310	v4017	c19161	4	I have all the girls just waiting for me to load up their save dataaaaaa!!!!!
311	v1484	\N	4	It's difficult for a virgin to use a tampon... but that doesn't mean it's impossible.
312	v1327	\N	4	They sure ought to release a 18+ patch for that.
313	v4	\N	9	That's right... the strongest girl sewing my clothes... those would be the strongest clothes...
314	v1726	\N	2	I've got a traumatic experience working as a Santa. When I sneaked in to place my presents, I accidentally saw the residents having sex.
315	v31083	c104343	3	A barbecue without toastmallows is like a pizza without pineapples!
317	v4599	\N	3	A girl shouldn't show her tears this easily. A girl's tears are their very last trump card and they are meant to be more valuable than any diamond.

323	v18550	c46911	4	Leave and go practice your bloody sodomy elsewhere.
324	v5883	\N	5	Wait, we still have to pay?! That's not rock and roll at all!
325	v893	\N	6	I'll need to grab my flamethrower and kill it with fire.
326	v19073	c49563	20	I-Isn't marriage, you know... That thing where the guy loses half his privileges but has to do double the work!?
327	v3161	c33085	4	Words can't express how grateful I am. I could even kiss her right on the cock.
328	v10304	\N	5	But anyways, practicing how to eat soft ice cream using a penis?
329	v414	\N	5	This isn't a performance, it's terrorism.
331	v22873	\N	2	Oh...you like being the meat in this fuck sandwich Vicky?
334	v27448	\N	14	No, I alone possess the special function of being utterly useless.

341	v16044	\N	4	You trying to stare words out of me?
342	v4028	\N	2	N-No... by the way, what are the activities of the Dog in a Pot Research Club?
343	v914	\N	8	I'm ugly, and being ugly is a crime.
344	v12849	\N	7	How often do you hallucinate hallucinations denying that they're hallucinations? We need to get you to a hospital.
345	v7849	\N	4	It only really gets good once you've got at least three girls. Everybody knows that!
347	v82	\N	3	If you never give up on anything, you'll never be able to move on. Not by a single step.
349	v17018	\N	17	He didn't seem to know his mother was his father, either.
351	v17	c28	8	So you want me to put the tip of this in that hole of yours?
352	v12694	\N	2	So it's private, but everyone knows and treats you unusually well. Do you work at a brothel?
353	v3112	\N	7	Hey Santa, digging through the trash really suits you.
354	v5240	c12298	9	Photograph? That's not a photograph. It's a CG.

356	v18760	\N	1	Oink!!
357	v16044	c41324	13	I mean, the protagonists are all unpopular virgins, yet they get to screw any girl they want. How is that realistic?
359	v31208	\N	6	Absolutely not! I'll fuck a lot of things, but a chair is too far!
360	v2632	\N	8	Do you have any of that ass medicine, by any chance? You know, the smeary stuff?
361	v12849	c22771	8	Don't worry, people don't come installed with a self-destruct function.
362	v1491	\N	2	Reach out to others as they reach out to you! Open up your heart and you'll have the POWER OF LOVE!
363	v15708	\N	2	I'm in the middle of tofu-ing, could you please not distract me?
364	v236	\N	6	Art is losing out to a pencil eraser.
365	v36	c9990	5	I'm your long lost brother. We were separated at birth.
366	v5	c1867	10	And we'd laugh so much, making our diaphragms cramp up, that we'd suffocate and be sent to the hospital in an ambulance!
367	v23281	\N	1	Involving yourself in a lovers' quarrel is like opening Pandora's box.
369	v16044	c26600	16	What should we do... Maybe I should try and cheer up your crotch? C'mon, little guy! You can do it! You can do it!
370	v248	c11470	7	So I've been demoted from a slave to a stray dog?
371	v19397	\N	3	I stand out without meaning to. It takes a rare brand of man for that.

373	v66	\N	2	Move and I'll irradiate you with this feeble infrared light!
374	v16337	\N	9	Why didn't you cum inside me?! fucking die!
375	v453	\N	4	I see. Before you go sleeping, you'll nicely brush your teeth, OK? Teeth are the bread and butter for a vampire!
376	v6572	\N	2	My my. Your face was quite priceless. I had no idea the human body was capable of such amusing distortion.
377	v131	\N	5	Oh, we're fine! Just fine! The more I crash, the better I get at flying.
378	v4981	\N	5	YES WE CUM!
379	v6710	\N	6	I-if you are intending to get me pregnant, I must ask you to follow the proper procedures!
380	v238	\N	1	You seem like you won't break even if you die.
381	v648	\N	3	This must be the first stage of the so called Tsundere Method...
382	v5154	\N	3	I'll suck that sucker like it's never been sucked before! I'll suck it good! I'll suck it to pieces! Just watch me!
383	v2596	\N	3	Huh!? My body's just compact, unlike yours! You just don't get it do you? You're all boobs, no brains!
384	v10665	\N	1	I never knew anyone who felt that good after going to the toilet. She must have had a really big bowel...

395	v914	\N	7	Yes. People are made to die.

400	v1474	\N	1	The weird scythe she is holding is kind of cute.
401	v12559	c14905	2	Could a bat fall in love with a pigeon? I was suddenly curious.
402	v5	c1863	17	Is it a problem that I don't have any friends? Does that bother you? Will it kill you?!
403	v1027	\N	2	Murder? No. My father's sin was simply being foolish.
404	v155	\N	1	I won't 'do' anything. I'll just abundantly, fiercely, mercilessly despise you.
405	v747	\N	4	Ready... steady... GORGONZOLA!
406	v71	\N	3	Rooftop Schoolgirl Boob-Grabbing Festival!
407	v1904	\N	3	Uhm, so basically... You mean there was a software upgrade from "Ugly Dude 2000" into "Futanari XP". Something like this?

409	v3161	\N	3	I'm cumming while I'm cumming!!!!
410	v9879	c5410	8	Come with me. I have 7,098 different types of drugs I want to test.
411	v3144	\N	2	The two of us are pretty strong, too. If we have a bamboo sword, at least.
412	v697	\N	9	The taste of gin and vermouth lingers on my lips. The only kiss I've known in years...
413	v11	\N	7	I searched until the sun set, and the only thing I figured out was how useless I am.
414	v13631	c17301	7	But I like changing the names of people's folders to 'Loli Pics'.
415	v7723	\N	2	Aw shiiit! Don't take it all off! Don't! Aw jeez, at least leave the socks on!
416	v29383	\N	3	Letting my genes go extinct is better than submitting myself to a man, don't you think?
417	v12302	\N	1	Eh!? You are afraid of... panties?
418	v20194	\N	4	Any girl, no matter how ugly they are, can end up looking adorable if you keep insisting how cute they are.

425	v17742	\N	2	It is my role as a man to bestow my love onto all life. I will delve into study, if love demands it.
426	v2016	\N	1	I live by my reputation. It is more valuable than money can be.

432	v1399	\N	8	I mean... I'm defective. Who wouldn't hate... a piece of trash like me...
433	v74	\N	4	Of course, the person I like is a thickheadedly thickheaded, super-thickheaded guy.
434	v20491	\N	6	Nice to meet you, I'm a beautiful girl.

442	v870	\N	7	This is the best eroge ever made. It has so much ero, and so much ge, that you just won't believe it.
443	v12694	\N	2	There ain't no luck out there that's dumb enough to help our sorry butts out. We made this happen.
444	v35	\N	3	After all, it wouldn't be good to do it on your sister's bed!
445	v427	\N	3	Let's degenerate
446	v211	\N	2	Sorry, I was born cute.
447	v16044	c77069	6	All you have to do is mate with him, Tsumugi.
449	v7679	\N	7	Listen up! The emptier your head, the more dreams you can stuff inside it, y'know!
450	v5	\N	4	Wa~, it has a boy's smell~
451	v29383	\N	11	A little sister is not a doll that exists to satisfy her brother's desires.
452	v812	\N	4	Fufu, I'm going to violate you.

454	v5883	\N	1	Subaru-kun, were you imagining the girls in skin-tight suits?
455	v3276	\N	1	All we ever do is have sex. Promise me a date at least once in a while.

458	v124	\N	7	What? Me, smell? You mistake my high-class perfume for smell? You ignorant lout!
459	v17018	\N	10	Is killing yourself really that upsetting?
460	v29383	\N	9	So noisy. How are you going to take responsibility if my ears get pregnant?
461	v17516	\N	1	Yep, you're cooler than a mole!
462	v12	c15848	1	Take me seriously, then after you are suprised, realize that it's impossible, and deny it.
463	v6245	c3886	4	You girls're so close. Yamato, Gen-san, let's take a bath together and play, too!
464	v1143	\N	10	Good. Be a man like a girl!!
466	v5883	\N	2	Y-Yashio-senpai, I'm expecting a two-hour collarbone-licking extravaganza after this.

492	v66	\N	5	I continued fondling the breasts with degrees of freedom similiar to that of an analog video game controller.
493	v599	\N	11	You're the type to say tricky things with a tricky face and have your penis pretend to be your brain. But your entire body is your penis.
494	v14878	\N	3	I-I can't believe it... A shut-in neet with a girlfriend... That's enough to tear the fabric of existence...
495	v231	\N	2	This is stupid...... It's not like I'm some dumb kid who loves giant robots.
496	v21535	c64821	1	Unlike Renji's penis, this penis is kind to me.
497	v19382	\N	3	As long as there is enough place to be able to have sex, there is no problem. ♥
498	v34090	\N	3	...lately, I have been feeling a little guilty that we are using the school library like a love hotel.
499	v15077	c21328	4	The threat of death during club activities was rather new to me.
501	v24803	\N	2	Mr. Kurono, you're male, right?
503	v17909	\N	5	When I say 'that', I could only mean 'that'. You have one in your trousers too, right, Nii-san? 'That' filthy symbol of youths.
504	v9124	\N	1	That's right! I'm a high society man, who doesn't care for worldly affairs! ...That's a lie. I'm sorry.
505	v5883	\N	4	I've never had a b-boy, um, stick his fingers into my mouth before...
506	v912	\N	4	If that was an act on his part, I would pay 10,000 yen to go see a movie he's starring in.
507	v12246	\N	4	（＊ノωノ）
509	v2016	\N	20	..........................................................................I see.
510	v28576	\N	2	...I don't need the internet to pick up chicks. Hell, I'm doing it right now.
511	v2368	\N	3	I can take a bath, walk around naked and eat a whole bucket of pudding by myself.
512	v309	\N	6	I'm a cum dumbster. Anybody's fine, any time. Please abuse me.
513	v18334	\N	1	It's all okay! God takes male sacrifices, too!
514	v231	\N	4	Be quiet! Only women make excuses! It's not manly!
515	v57	c1374	10	I want to go on a date! We'll play MMORPGS all night long! And then I want you to confess your love to me by saying 'let's grind together, baby!'
516	v156	\N	1	When I really act like a princess, I practically ooze elegance!
517	v2093	\N	1	If you lie, your dick will grow.
518	v211	\N	6	It isn't not that nothing has not unhappened.
519	v17516	\N	5	If you're so fixated on the mysterious aspect, then you should go out with an axolotl or something.
520	v3031	\N	2	Uuu... My student scolded me.
521	v899	\N	8	If you have time to scream, why don't you suck my dick?
522	v38	\N	5	There was no such thing as an ideal route - there were only several good ones.
523	v9124	c6967	9	I don't want a girlfriend that vents her sexual desires using pizza.
524	v14265	c21481	7	I dunno what to think about a guy who has his girlfriend's dad clean his ears...
525	v646	\N	4	Wow... It's the first time I've seen one that isn't covered by mosaic.
526	v8158	\N	4	Getting that black belt in Litter Picking certainly paid off!
527	v210	\N	9	That's one small step for mankind, one giant leap for a man.
528	v1299	\N	10	His daughter had been kidnapped, and he was stuck unclogging a toilet.
529	v382	\N	7	Being nervous around chicks is one thing, but you act like that around me, and people are gonna think I'm a homo.
530	v17909	\N	10	Hello, it's me, Neco-Arc, the sommelier queen of the bad end industry who was so sexy that she got banned from appearing in the main story
531	v10804	\N	8	Music will save the world! Fuck yeah!
532	v5154	\N	2	Lies are like colors. The more you pile up, the blacker things get.
533	v12849	\N	7	Understood coach! Please tamper with my body!
535	v710	\N	2	Zawacchi, how are you today? Are your hit points green again?
536	v7679	c6613	7	Kehehe, for you to actually greet me in the morning... I praise your admirable endeavor, slave.
537	v18760	c41747	3	Lab coats are pretty much made for the beach.
538	v31054	\N	6	And yes, I am interested in guys who look like maniacs and I'm not ashamed of that.
539	v9879	c5401	7	I always think this, but math class never seems to actually use numbers.
541	v893	c92947	9	Can't say I've ever been applauded for knowing how to make cup noodles before...
542	v5154	\N	5	What does yesterday being Tuesday have to do with today being Thursday!?
543	v12	c15848	5	Okay, if you can catch my spit with your face, I'll think about it.
544	v2622	\N	7	Huh? Did she instinctively realize that I was a pervert?
545	v5295	\N	4	Feelings and thoughts are quick to change... but if I seize your libido, one of the big three human urges, it's likely I can seize the rest of you.
546	v3161	\N	3	If you ever do have a child, you can give birth here. We can hold an event where you give birth in front of a paying audience.
547	v5	c1874	13	Young man, it's philosophical as long as one doesn't understand it. It is no longer a philosophy if you understand it.
548	v18807	\N	5	Dude, your choice of who to help out today at lunch was clearly the branch point of your fate!
549	v155	\N	2	That's right, mother, I'm jealous of father! Mmmn... that bountiful bust of yours is just irresista-booble!
550	v24	\N	13	Come, try to close your eyes. And try to remember. What form did you have?
551	v26414	c85057	17	A cat. I just invited a cat on a date.
552	v14269	\N	1	Ah, I get it. She's become a rare random encounter, hasn't she?
553	v812	\N	3	I'll do my best! I'm going to melt Mom too!
554	v414	c513	2	A girl's heart is like a haunted house!
555	v5652	\N	15	Churches are where humans have sex, right?
556	v8322	\N	9	If God really existed, he probably would have stopped me from hiring my own sister as a prostitute.
557	v1306	\N	9	Damm her and her needlessly big tits...
558	v646	\N	2	Vodka is a Russian's life! If you cut a Russian's arm off, vodka will flow out instead of blood!
559	v4128	\N	5	Please, sex me!
561	v7723	\N	5	I will now proceed to spank Michiru-sama's butt ten times and then say something edifying!
562	v183	\N	2	I find that those who care nothing for the suffering of others are the ones who scream loudest at their own pain. Don't you agree?
563	v30162	\N	6	It's not the first time I've dismantled a human being, so don't worry about it.
564	v903	\N	1	Oh, no, it's nothing. Kazushi was just raping Rin in his imagination. Really, excuse him.
565	v14269	c17415	3	That competitive mindset causes social differences in this capitalist world. It's destroying the economy. Stop trying to defeat me. You'll bring this country to ruin.
566	v57	\N	12	Onee-chan, this isn't training! It's, it's... it's domestic violence!
567	v6572	\N	1	Operation Boost Luna's Boobies begins... NOW!
568	v5316	c891	2	...What? My whole existence amounts to being her brother?
569	v11	\N	19	I don't mind losing against someone, but there's no way I'll lose against myself!
570	v26837	\N	3	You want me to learn from it... for the next time we have sex? Ugh, what kind of convoluted fetish is this?!
571	v8158	\N	7	I see you have interests that delve deep into the depths of depravity. I fully endorse it. Do keep it up.
572	v10304	\N	9	Well, I do love shogi, but I don't get sexually aroused by a shogi board, you know?
573	v23281	\N	1	Check it out... your dick is diamonds.
574	v15125	\N	4	I will stop at nothing to protect my client! I don't care who I make an enemy of!
575	v16208	\N	3	Good to know I have a fucking weeaboo living under my roof again.
576	v12794	\N	1	Where's your mind at, bitch? Aren't you just looking to save yourself? Spare yourself from all this suffering?
577	v1306	\N	4	But i wanna argue with youuu! Kou! Let's fight over somethiiing!
578	v17909	\N	3	Chicken? Why would I be a bird?
579	v12559	\N	4	Oh right, girls that pretty don't use the toilet.
580	v156	\N	6	The ground can be a dangerous weapon if it hits you hard.
581	v18760	\N	2	Huh? Um... Shinji, your towel looks like... it's changing shape...
582	v5	c1863	1	I don't know what's going on, but I'm sure that it's your fault, Riki. Apologize to her.
583	v751	\N	4	Urinal cakes are no match for the forces of gravity.
584	v370	\N	3	I'm not a kid! I'm a legitimate, adult male!
585	v26414	c85057	7	I know it's a bit late to be asking this question... but should we REALLY be leaving a cat in charge of our finances?
586	v22658	c85083	8	Clearly, not having a sprite is the source of all my troubles. Oh well, let's have tea, then.
587	v496	c11812	2	Searching... The Three Laws of Robotics... Search results found: 0.
588	v12561	\N	1	No it's fine, if you show me your underwear.
589	v12849	c32937	3	And I, whose artistic muscles will be hailed as "Mjolnir," work together, we may just pull it off, huh?
590	v211	\N	3	You better watch your back when you walk the streets at night, you... cunting galge protag!
591	v68	\N	5	Hmm... I would love to show people a movie of this technique... But unfortunately I can't do that in a sound novel...!
592	v18498	c40662	6	Please stop talking to your underwear!
594	v1491	\N	4	Do you really think the flames of my heart can be described by mere math? Preposterous! Am I a 0 or 1? The only number I seek is INFINITY!
595	v22873	\N	1	DAMN YOU CHOCOLATE PEANUT BUTTER SPREAD!
596	v5154	\N	23	I ask of all gathered here: those who have ever jacked off to Kazami Yuuji, please raise your hands.
597	v6291	\N	4	Insolence. I'm not just touching. I'm politely massaging your breasts.
598	v2622	\N	4	"I'll introduce her. The transfer student is the Rusian President.
599	v3161	\N	5	And that, my boys, is how a woman shits. Any comments?
600	v3850	\N	5	...Sorry. I never told you, but I... I'm not really your mother, I'm your father.
601	v19773	\N	2	I demand you to do the Moe-Moe Kyun for me!!
602	v211	\N	5	Shit, most bitches roll over and spread their legs for a sugary treat.
604	v18830	\N	3	As an adolescent girl, it's only natural that I should have an unstable gender identity.
606	v922	\N	5	I am a tree. A tree that grows in the hallway!
607	v1896	\N	2	I've neglected nothing. My boobs are already 84D.
608	v231	\N	5	Where's the user support for my life? I could use a fucking patch here.
609	v18060	\N	2	If you want to correct people, do it over YouTube. I'm not in the mood.
610	v1813	\N	7	It's all this world is-- either you fuck, or you get fucked.
611	v24987	\N	6	You see, I play 3 H-games a month, so my reading ability has been getting trained well
612	v22873	\N	3	Always trying to take all the cocks for themselves. They are so selfish and rude.
613	v7849	\N	3	I, um, don't think that's my collarbone you're staring at..
614	v12	\N	3	In Japan, we also have this wonderful goverment organization called police.
616	v26532	\N	11	Which is harder, that or what I've got in my pants?
617	v7809	\N	3	Remove these shorts of obfuscation and let us gaze upon itーーthis so-called "hose"!
618	v7014	\N	3	Incite another murder?! You're makin' me sound like the bad guy!
619	v22230	\N	8	Wh-What is this "pourn" thing you speak of? I surely don't know of it, whatever it is.
620	v21261	\N	3	I Just... I just thought that I could become a normie if I had bigger boobs!
621	v46744	\N	3	Please understand my feeling as someone who got called an ambulance because he had a morning wood!
622	v155	\N	1	I, Takayashiki Aoba, have no openings throughout my daily life!
623	v6359	\N	2	Now, be nice... I'm just the toilet paper.
624	v5871	\N	1	Well, at any rate, it's nice to meet you. Since I'm such an amazing guy, let me know if you need help with anything.
625	v438	\N	5	I just can't live there, in America. Because you know what? They put peanut butter over a jam! And that's just damn weird!
626	v7773	\N	5	Lolicon is justice!
628	v14265	\N	4	A planetarium?... By planetarium, you mean a planetarium?
629	v238	\N	3	Uu.... I was eaten...
630	v25366	\N	3	Moral of the story: Make sex friends with a friend of a friend, and in the end, it will bite you in the rear end.
631	v88	\N	5	One must never ask for a woman's age. This is an ironclad rule established to ensure the survival of the human race.
632	v38	\N	1	Would you not mutter such scary things under your breath, please?
633	v2153	c16497	32	Without love, it cannot be seen.
634	v71	\N	1	I told you not to eat those mushrooms!
635	v4	\N	7	You should just watch out for cars, crows and a baker guy whose eyes look piercing
636	v68	\N	4	...I'm so lonely, like a poor kitten crying in a cardboard box because no one wants her. Mi-Mi-...
637	v515	\N	2	Listen up, Takashiro-san. We're not pretty little princesses, okay? We're whores. We work ourselves to the brink just to put food in our mouths.
638	v29445	\N	3	This is the first time I've ever seen anyone eat meat with dollar signs in their eyes.
640	v20032	\N	13	KILL THE PAST!
641	v7861	\N	2	Kazuna-san's left and right testicles.... I will move around and around until they changed places.
642	v17018	\N	10	I'd thought he was just some weirdo, but he was actually a pretty considerate weirdo.
643	v3192	\N	4	Oh, please don't make that face like a long-dead boyfriend was really alive but turned out to be a blood-related younger brother.
645	v2002	\N	20	You got your childhood friend to change your diaper? I'm jealous, man. What eroge is that from?
646	v11	\N	40	"Oh, so Sakura's already awake." Then she should be in the kitchen.
647	v1377	\N	19	Everybody has the right to live, no matter how retarded they may be.
648	v84	\N	5	Even though you have a splendid cock, how long are you going to pretend to be a coward?
649	v1377	\N	3	You looked so festive, like a carriage horse in heat galloping off to a stable full of mares.
650	v3161	c14527	1	It was a real hassle trying to clean the place up. Your cum seemed to find its way onto just about everything.
651	v548	\N	1	Me, come at you? Give me a fucking break. You're the one who needs to crawl out of the gutter and come at me, shithead.
652	v3112	\N	10	I am shocked and appalled that guessing at random has not yielded better results.
653	v210	c38502	4	A man riding a missile. This was... this was amazing.
654	v6357	\N	6	Sex... by myself?! U-Um, y-you... y-you want me to have sex all by myself?! Eh?! B-But how?!
655	v5154	\N	9	Hrm, I see. Thank you for your valuable opinion. I'll file it under "not helpful in the slightest."
656	v67	\N	2	A man's heart doesn't add money to your wallet!
657	v24634	\N	5	No thanks, I'll pass. Don't want to get between you and your suicide.
658	v12309	\N	2	I'm not a stalker, I'm a brocon! No, scratch that, too.
659	v21269	\N	14	Do people taste good?
660	v17909	\N	3	Kohaku-san really must have taken a liking to the butter cake, because she's stroking the snack packet like it's some kind of treasure.
661	v15143	\N	3	For humans it's important what's inside. Of their underpants.
662	v8213	\N	5	Farewell, my virginity.
663	v4806	\N	2	There isn't anything suspicious with his bank account other than how little money goes in and out.
664	v6572	\N	3	My body! My body's all see-through and crap. What's going on?
665	v13631	c17297	6	You seem to be misunderstanding me, Sorako. I am no pervert. I simply do not hesitate when it comes to my desires!
666	v21269	\N	18	You're clearly a bottom.
667	v3746	\N	3	Saori-san, if Onii-chan does 108 techniques to make you pregnant, what would you do?
668	v35	\N	2	Um... am I supposed to take off my clothes?
669	v18644	c43189	4	I've got a photo from when you were fat. Want to see it?!
670	v3161	c33085	3	Of course I don't actually say that out loud because... well, I'd prefer to live.
671	v4981	\N	3	If I don't scream now, when will I scream? My libido is out of control! Nobody can stop it now!
672	v32333	\N	6	I'm posting this review because I think the community that has built up around this game is nothing but a moronic circle jerk.
673	v18760	c41751	5	Do you want me to ram this fork into your bald head for real this time?
674	v10304	\N	10	Ah, but now that I think about it, your right hand has been your girlfriend until now, right? Is your hand actually my rival in love?
675	v438	\N	15	Anyway, I can't live in America! They can just FUCK OFF! It's not a place for a real human to live!
676	v21269	\N	8	Just be grateful I didn't tie you up shibari bondage style.
677	v7849	\N	2	Damned straight! My flag is firmly planted now. The day is totally won
678	v414	\N	5	I wish all the girls in the world were my girlfriends and I could have sex with each one every day.
679	v16560	\N	3	......Somehow it feels like we have stealthily sex in your pocket.
680	v4037	\N	5	Get men aroused? I can do such a thing! Such crude, unsightly creatures are nothing!
681	v8158	\N	2	If you want to be closer to someone, you have to lay down your weapon and take off your armor.
682	v5883	\N	8	Are you like an eroge hero who suddenly acts like a sadistic old perv once the sex scene starts!? I get it.
683	v18760	c61599	6	He's a madman that's only good for ass-fucking.
685	v5154	\N	4	Plannin' to wash his back with yer fat ol' titties, I expect. Geeeez, how slutty can ya get?
686	v19073	\N	5	"I want to have more indirect kisses with you" sounds like you're the kind of weirdo who licks girls' flutes.
687	v13631	c17303	4	Whenever things get complicated between a man and a woman, it's two hundred percent the man's fault.
689	v382	\N	18	Whose eyes are those eyes?
690	v8158	\N	7	The Volunteer Club requesting for volunteers makes for an interesting slice of irony.
691	v711	\N	17	I object! That was...objectionable!
692	v7	c74	20	Yes. I'm the girl you killed yesterday. I'm glad you remember.
693	v2016	\N	13	You're no hero! You're no demon! You're just a worthless motherfucker who doesn't know what he is!
694	v17825	\N	5	I think the secret of a happy marriage is for the husband to be under his wife's ass, literally.
695	v211	\N	6	Anyway, I'm really grateful. If I were a guy, I'd lock you up and love you every night.
696	v20148	\N	4	Oohhh... I can see it... I can see the future where you spread your legs for him!
697	v2344	\N	4	...It'll be fine, I'm a heroine after all... They have a special ability not to get fat no matter how much they eat...
698	v700	\N	2	Miracle is a convenient word. People use it whenever they can't find an answer to a question.
699	v14761	\N	3	How mean, please don't call me a rotten mermaid. You know how bad rotten fish smells right?
700	v19769	\N	4	Though I had my doubts about comparing girls to curry, it was the first thing I thought of.
701	v15125	\N	10	Tea! Someone bring English tea! In England, no discussions take place without tea!
702	v19397	\N	2	I can't tell you how bad it is, but yeah, you're in love with me.
703	v31659	\N	8	It begins to dawn on you that everything you just did may have been a colossal waste of time.
704	v414	\N	3	I guess she values her shampoo more than my life. That's not very flattering.
705	v1143	\N	3	All the cute girls in the world are offerings to me.
706	v264	\N	2	Ummm, oniichan, don't touch me there...
707	v13774	\N	10	I'm gonna let you know right now, you can't clear my route.
708	v57	\N	15	Oh shut up. You're the one who thought R.E.M. stood for "Really Enjoy Masturbating"...
709	v23281	\N	2	Man, this god's one heck of a guy, though. Super understanding.
710	v17018	\N	6	Be the biggest fool you can be.
711	v2153	\N	2	The truth...is uninteresting.
712	v508	\N	2	Fufufu. After all, both sex and ritual is best when it's done with a young one.
713	v12402	\N	20	Is there any window in particular you'd like to be thrown out of?
714	v66	\N	15	A woman's heart is like English. I don't get it at all.
715	v24	\N	41	The food they were given had small bombs in it, which exploded from inside their stomachs.
716	v19769	\N	2	Affirmative. The ship has sunken.
717	v38	\N	5	If she has you whipped *already*, you'll be in for hell later on. Believe me, I know.
718	v9124	\N	1	So you're going to throw your son to the hounds, just because taking care of me is a pain?
719	v17763	\N	2	This hand of mine burns red! Its loud roar tells me to defeat the butterfly!
720	v13046	\N	4	There was an study conducted by, um, a f-foreign university ... It was scientifically proven that s-sheep were best animals for counting.
721	v27519	\N	6	Ngh, it's out of memory...? I shouldn't have set that big boobs mod to max...!
722	v751	\N	2	High-heeled women need to cling to their man for a safety reason.
723	v19073	c49563	13	Is it normal for male family members to share their porn with each other?
724	v25366	\N	6	You and Emi-chan went shopping together all alone...? That's already basically sex!
725	v5154	\N	1	I am a bitch, what of it?
726	v3144	\N	51	Even girls have dicks in their hearts!
727	v211	\N	9	Alright, meeting adjourned. God has better things to do.
728	v1143	\N	15	I'm going to make 100 friends! I only need to make 100 more to reach the goal!
729	v751	\N	16	Those damn Americans are rushing our position. They want to reoccupy this country, even if they can only do so in a video game.
730	v67	\N	14	If you didn't have that thing inbetween your legs, you'd be such a pretty girl!
731	v22145	c106210	5	You've been drugging me with your cum?!
732	v1306	\N	7	"Hmm"...? Dude, can't you be more into this? I'm trying to brag here...
733	v18550	c46911	4	Have I seen you somewhere before? Bloody, you peasants all look the same to me.
734	v12759	\N	1	Lost things will never return.
735	v7	\N	10	You are infinitely better than an alarm clock.
736	v19125	\N	5	ALLLLL RIIIIIIIGHT!! Lady Luck's really spread her legs for us here!
737	v1155	\N	2	I wouldn't say it's not as if you're not un-useful.
738	v20032	\N	17	Every single motherfucker thinks they're gonna save the fuckin' world... why not do something about the shitty economy or whatever instead?
739	v5136	\N	4	Oh snap!!!! I do not hear such a truth...!?
740	v370	\N	2	Girls are the same as aliens. Those limp-body-walking-things with soft chests...it goes way over my head.
741	v3161	\N	5	Mikako, don't let that dick escape!
743	v67	\N	19	Men don't belong in the kitchen.
744	v12849	c22775	4	So I figured I'd go to a school that was more low-key. That way, whenever big stuff happened, I could grab the spotlight and become a main heroine.
745	v18157	c92040	7	Turns out having to lift up my own gut so they can suck me off turns them off. Never gone past that.
746	v2002	\N	14	Who're you calling an American virgin?
747	v10933	\N	1	This position... is embarassing. It looks like I'm being cooked alive.
748	v747	\N	2	Don't be silly. Porn holds more value than art.
749	v183	\N	7	In my experience, rape is more efficient than normal torture.
750	v6245	\N	4	Isn't this what they call entrance BGM?
751	v28253	\N	1	But just to make sure... vaccines are okay?
752	v20032	\N	9	I feel like digging these holes helped us grow.
753	v71	\N	4	You're the Titless Twintail Monster!
754	v66	\N	4	Girls aren't just holes for men to penetrate!
755	v602	\N	7	If you were a hair you'd be a nose hair! At least if you were a pubic hair you'd serve some purpose!
756	v5240	\N	2	Eika-chan, press ○△□XXX to shoot beams!
757	v16208	\N	5	You ought to write down all your hopes and dreams, and then burn them so they will never be heard again.
758	v181	\N	3	Firearms are such a bore! Killing with your own hands is where it's at!
759	v5	\N	2	Uwaa, you touched me in a weird place!!
761	v747	\N	3	Ah, but since he didn't react to my feminine charm, he's gotta be gay. Guess you shouldn't judge by appearance!
762	v12849	c22771	3	You sure worry about some strange things. Relax. Anti-gravitons will keep her skirt from flipping.
764	v174	\N	4	There's no way I'd go puupuukupuu with someone as stupid, idiotic and forgetful as you.
765	v155	\N	6	Don't knock erotica. If it weren't for erotica, you would never have been born.
766	v20491	\N	1	Your t-shirt is mine, and what mine is mine!
767	v648	\N	3	That was an indirect tit grab! I won't wash this hand for a week!
768	v1306	\N	5	Hey, young lady... Wanna have a heated discussion about the existence of virtual sex organs?
769	v1392	\N	3	Hikaru, you'll grow up to be a good girl, even if not really bright, teacher guarantees.
770	v2016	\N	2	You who would call yourself my master, hast thou the resolve to become what I am?
771	v68	\N	1	But this kind of flaw is a good thing to have, otherwise I'd be too perfect!
772	v972	\N	5	In which case, for whom do Nakano-senpai's bulges bulge for?
773	v11	\N	19	...You stupid Shirou. I told you it hurts. ...I'm never going to have sex with you again.
774	v17909	\N	8	Huh!? I haven't been drinking! I'm always seri~ous!... is what I'd like to say, but truth is I'm high. Like, really high.
776	v211	\N	11	If this was a bishoujo game, a choice window would pop up here.
777	v914	\N	8	First of all, if everyone's equal, then why have I never had a girlfriend?
778	v22230	c66161	8	Nope. Actually, uh, what guy would randomly carry around a pair of cat ears with them? That's a little creepy.
779	v914	\N	8	I tried not to kill as much as I could help it, but I'm sure most of them are dead. Man, what a bummer.
784	v23281	\N	8	Don't just marry me without my consent!
785	v14269	\N	2	What the hell's with you?! Why are you even here?! I'll sue you depending on your answer!
786	v5316	c895	2	What is this I hear? Are you trying to diss whipped cream? Is that what your words say?
787	v18315	\N	1	Let's blend... our lives together.
788	v11624	\N	1	Just where on earth do you greet people by massaging their breasts!?
789	v211	\N	5	'Petting' apparently means something sexual.
790	v1060	\N	6	I haven't got the foggiest idea who you are, but we're now hole brothers with this.
791	v17018	\N	4	Only an idiot would smell something he knows will reek.
792	v5	c1865	1	Make it as mild as it can be please...
793	v7769	\N	6	Give the edible insect research association a budget!
794	v68	\N	13	Nice to meet you. I'm Keiichi's meow meow, Rika.
795	v23742	\N	4	Yuragi politely thanked the hanny and then shattered him with her hammer.
796	v430	\N	10	＿|￣|○ 
797	v155	\N	1	That's right. I have a rank one qualification in gentlemanliness.
798	v46744	\N	4	Onii-chan, big breasts are indeed the best!
799	v1178	\N	2	Ahaha, should I drown you in my piss like this? It is the best way to die for a perverted teacher like you, don't you agree?
800	v210	\N	2	He was probably the only true weirdo among us.
801	v12692	\N	1	That's because I'm a tentacle.
802	v1865	\N	5	Fundamentally, we Martians have sex by holding hands.
803	v88	\N	1	Even the most trifling of words may result in a relationship mishap.
804	v2930	\N	2	Yeah! I'm Pandam. Jean-Claude Pan Dam - that's my name.
805	v22230	c66155	14	Look, I know you can't see it, but I DO have tits! They're there! There's actual softness there!
807	v646	\N	2	And the moment when you actually came, did that happen to be inside, or perchance outside?
808	v21552	\N	3	Converting the cost of everything into arcade game credits is a bad habit men have.
809	v155	\N	4	That's like a third-rate line from a third-rate climax of a third-rate drama.
810	v11033	\N	3	I don't make a habit of getting hit by cars in other people's dreams.
811	v2341	\N	4	You won't ever understand how delicate and fragile, like the black, metallic body of a car, my heart is.
812	v9093	\N	13	Hey, exactly how much of an age gap do you need to call somebody a "Lolicon"?
813	v3161	c33085	2	Having to see a dude's penis in the middle of eating makes me start to lose my appetite.
814	v729	c3141	2	Screw you, man! What gives you the right to ruin perfectly good trampling by a pretty girl?!
815	v19073	c49563	25	I love lolis! Flat chests are the best! Nothing beats washboard boobs!
816	v2016	\N	6	I love killing people.
817	v1306	\N	3	Did H. R. Giger design this?
818	v1027	\N	2	You must never set foot in that place. If you value your life. You must not even imagine what lies hidden inside. If you value your life.
819	v414	\N	2	I remember Murakami-kun said punk music is 'anger', but in our case, it's more like 'people getting angry at us', huh?
820	v9124	\N	8	My acting for the part of a dead tree was incredible. Everyone loved it.
824	v16221	\N	1	Asaga eagerly opened the bento container, revealing a mixture straight out of a hardcore tentacle fetish game.
826	v97	\N	9	I can't see people as human
827	v12402	\N	7	Spend eternity with me... in the gentle embrace of darkness.
830	v51	c4914	1	Haauu... it hurts... it hurts, Onii-chan...
831	v14069	\N	3	If I were to hate your perverted side I would be denying your entire existence.
835	v17909	\N	6	I'm gonna cause an earthquake 'round here. 'Cause you see, my body's vibrator is now on max!
836	v646	\N	4	I was born from a gun, I was raised with guns, and I'll die by a gun! Guns are my everything, and my life is a gun itself!
837	v66	\N	1	Why are your movements so fluffy!? Isn't that strange!?
838	v7773	\N	7	Lolicon is a crime!
839	v912	\N	4	Man, alive people are great!
840	v17	\N	7	I'm not getting enough vegetables...I'm not getting enough vegetables...I'm not...
841	v4137	\N	5	Seriously... You guys are stupid, annoying, and... irreplaceable. I couldn't ask for better friends...
842	v51	c4766	15	Actually, my granddad's dying wish was for me to not run in the corridors.
843	v5883	c36546	7	Apologize! Y-You need to apologize to the 120 million lolicons nationwide!
844	v2622	c3734	8	This is humanity's crystal of wisdom, an eroge.
845	v765	c87844	2	Forgive me, Yuu-san. What I unloaded last night has already finished being replenished.
846	v264	\N	1	I didn't know we had enough money to even worry about managing it.
847	v10608	\N	4	I got called a doorknob...
848	v273	\N	2	Because it's necromantic xylophone.
849	v12849	c22771	5	I wonder what drove him to worship muscles?
850	v36	\N	5	Hi, I'm Mr. Culprit
851	v13	\N	12	I am a seagull.
852	v3971	\N	6	Indian people don't tell lies.
853	v1759	\N	2	Tsubasa-chan, you idiot! If you like breasts so much, you should just marry them!
854	v39689	c119098	5	But she stinks kinda good.
855	v2153	\N	8	We'll meet again. When something else cries.
856	v10665	\N	4	Don't worry about it. They say that childhood trauma helps build character.
857	v33	\N	10	I have a special power of forgetting people's faces after twelve hours.
858	v13242	\N	4	I'm going to masturbate so kindly get out!
859	v7721	\N	3	You looked handsome from behind, but that face is a bit of a consolation prize, isn't it...?
860	v17	c32	11	When you close your eyes, I disappear.
861	v3161	c14527	3	After you passed out, Lady Marisa was bent on waking you with a stun gun. I had a heck of a time to talk her out of it.
862	v687	\N	2	The guests here eat, sleep, and hoard secrets like squirrels hoard nuts.
863	v24803	\N	7	Yeah, that's it! Cocaine addiction!
864	v82	\N	2	There's no such thing in this world as a person who isn't allowed to be happy. That's what I think.
865	v15708	\N	2	Ahaha, you're right. Soujin does kinda have the air of a cactus about him.
866	v1143	\N	9	Pu-puriiizu... meato... in my... mouse from... mooningu!
869	v39689	c119099	3	Oh, chill. That just means I get to go on an autistic rant about firearms history.
870	v751	c241	2	I was in a dark forest, being chased by a scary man with scissors. It was horrible.
871	v11	\N	12	Ridiculous, you do not understand even now...?! This is your final warning, Shirou. Please make lunch right now!
872	v93	\N	1	Do not fear. There is no shame in being defeated, shame is in running away.
873	v19769	\N	4	I only have one request: Could you help me realize the dream of making a hole into a forehead?
874	v2016	\N	27	I have faith in my evil.
875	v1474	\N	8	SHIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIT!!!
876	v7014	\N	3	Maaaan, lookit me chasin' down my dreams and shit. I am one frickin' extreme badass!
877	v5	c193	8	My body may look strong as steel, but my heart is as soft as tissue. Can't you wrap your words in Saran wrap just a little?
878	v231	\N	7	Does the flowchart of my life only lead to bad ends!?
880	v17909	\N	8	Well then, pleased to meet you Shiki. I'm gonna have you take responsibility for killing me, okay?
881	v1474	\N	3	Those who ignore girls in puberty are straying from the right path.
882	v17018	\N	5	Geniuses need to be idle.
883	v716	\N	6	(Should I be grateful this coffee's only hot enough to give me 1st degree burns...?)
884	v3271	\N	2	If there was a person completely superior to me, it would be no less than a god.
885	v23281	\N	2	Is this, like, the plot of an anime?
886	v16560	\N	3	And what comes now..... Well... I asked (my parents) and got permission to perform sexual intercourse with you, so...
887	v32333	\N	3	MY CAREER PASSION IS TO NOT BE A STABBED HOMELESS GUY By Even Winter, Uncertified Life Coach
888	v18770	\N	3	Wait, does this mean waifus can pop out of monitors now!?
889	v2441	\N	1	I love you more than roast pork... more than fried rice, that Mai cooks for me... and a lot, a lot more than steak...!!!
890	v28	\N	5	It's absolutely meaningless, just like the Japanese government nowadays.
891	v7849	\N	1	So I've been accepted by the family, then? My tears of joy overflow at the prospect. I must be red as a beet right now
892	v24110	\N	3	Ugh, you suck and I hate you.
893	v430	\N	6	You know you look just as silly carrying a sword as I do without one.
894	v914	\N	12	I'm not too familiar with law, but I believe lynching is illegal.
895	v155	\N	4	In front of this lady, I guess even Buddha would become a wimp.
896	v1178	\N	2	My first time is with my student, moreover it is her first time too. Is that the right thing to do?!
897	v8158	c9360	4	I spent all of last year's Shiomi Festival participating in a self-sponsored Reading Festival at my apartment, actually.
898	v729	c3121	4	The horrid image of a 50-years-old man cross-dressing scarred my battered mind.
899	v155	\N	3	Uh, Jin-san? Tsukasa-kun told me to tell you he's not here.
900	v11203	\N	6	His hand that was like a knob grasshopper spider creeped over my public region.
901	v19654	\N	4	A rice terrorist like you shouldn't look so pleased with yourself.
902	v5154	\N	13	A sandwich walks into a bar. The barman says, "Sorry, we don't serve food in here."
903	v17516	\N	1	Kunimi-kun, there's something I want to talk to you about. Bring a first-aid kit and meet me out back behind the school building.
904	v10304	c18196	5	All right, me too, me too! Yuma, let's go take a piss together!
905	v729	\N	3	To be honest... I am the owner of a very special sense of smell that can spot virgin boys and girls.
906	v700	\N	2	I don't have a girlfriend, but I'm determined to get one this year. Too bad it's not easy as flipping a switch. Girlfriend on, girlfriend off.
907	v74	\N	3	So, maids... really exist...
908	v5154	\N	13	Wasn't rape. He had the pillow's consent.
909	v2153	\N	22	I'm an intellectual rapist who enjoys exposing the things people try to hide, get it?
910	v38	\N	2	...This is why mysterious creatures are a pain.
911	v19125	\N	4	Real food can be pretty delicious, you know.
912	v14265	c19047	10	So you want to feel the lingering warmth of her butt from her chair while she's gone!
913	v751	\N	4	Don't underestimate me. I was Buddha in a previous life.
914	v1327	\N	5	One who chases both breasts doesn't get a single one
915	v747	\N	1	What a weak girl, to faint from a little stab in the ear.
917	v167	\N	1	Senpai is Senpai because you have a really bad personality
918	v18157	c92042	9	I'm going to take a shower. Do you guys want anything?
919	v22230	c66161	11	That really doesn't sound like a good reason to put the color of my NIPPLES into this database.
920	v438	\N	2	Now that should make her Like Points up! I'm betting that she wants to spread her legs for me even now!
921	v18830	\N	1	Michiru-sama, are you imitating an electric vibrator?
922	v16103	\N	5	The only thing I had in my pockets was the underwear of my younger sister.
923	v13912	\N	1	An invaluable component of every woman's beauty is a flawless ass.
924	v13353	\N	2	So nobody woke you up...? You must have no friends.
925	v1143	\N	2	Who are those, game characters? Can you see their panties?
926	v231	\N	6	I spank bad children like you with my 'Super West Invincible Robot, Version No: 28.72, Upgrades: It's just stronger, dammit!'
927	v2016	\N	14	The devil I shall meet, the devil I shall cut. The saint I shall meet, the saint I shall cut.
928	v4806	\N	2	On top of that, you thought you'd go around making these delicious omelets. You got some nerve, punk.
929	v870	\N	3	I haven't seen you since I watched your sleeping face with binoculars this morning
930	v646	\N	4	Fine let's take this outside... Oh wait, we're already outside. Let's take this inside!
931	v22313	\N	9	The world gently breathes a sigh—— in its chest, in its eyes... and in its heart.
933	v5585	\N	4	Having hairs around your dick does not make you an adult.
934	v22702	\N	2	If someone were to draw a diagram of my brain right now, it would be filled with the word "fart".
935	v648	\N	3	I don't care how many Bad Ends I get, I'll have my revenge!
936	v44	\N	8	Stories...? What, porn games have stories?
937	v2002	\N	7	How do i know that? Because I, too, have few friends! Muhahaha!
938	v71	\N	3	What is a 'date'? A very philosophical question indeed!
940	v5871	\N	1	Tsk, tsk, tsk. You just don't get it, Kasumi-chin. Isn't it precisely because it's a game that we can go all out?
941	v6245	c3508	9	Ooh. The identity of the unidentified flying object was my sister.
942	v1159	\N	4	Ehh, what is this? My dick is too small that it can't even tear the hymen. Heyyy! Is that it?
943	v496	c4522	1	That's wonderful, Onii-chan! It's amazing how you can find happiness even in meaningless things!!
946	v24	\N	12	Uryu...... Doing all of the Seven Sisters would be pretty tough......
947	v5883	\N	4	Listen up. Boing refers to a woman's breasts. This'll be on the exam.
948	v28253	\N	5	Motherfucker, you ain't Catholic. You're just a weirdo cosplayer.
949	v438	\N	3	I see that guys are kinda closer to being an animal than girls are. I pity them a little now...
950	v8158	\N	3	Apparently we're taking on the universe now... How could I not have noticed?
951	v5451	\N	4	You put your thumb, fore and middle finger in the three holes of the bowling ball. It's like fiddling with the anus, vagina and clitoris at the same time.
952	v3110	\N	4	One gram of breast is worth one kilogram of gold.
953	v548	\N	3	Hmm? Do I need a reason? I'm here because I'm a soldier, much like yourself. War is our profession, murder our currency.
954	v19073	c44770	13	...Treat me like an adult while patting my head, Master.
955	v9205	\N	5	You've just earned the right to call yourself the head cook of the underworld. A Hell's Chef, if you will.
956	v747	\N	4	My love for you is like diarrhea: I just can't hold it in!
957	v1491	\N	2	Zubannn!! (←Sound of stepping on the gas)
958	v18498	c40664	4	Bwahaha! I'll just ward them off with my secret technique: Friendly Greeting!
959	v1155	\N	1	You don't need to be so nervous. The expectations on you aren't that high.
960	v28712	\N	4	I've already made my preparations... I've wrapped my pillow with a towel so it'll be alright even if it gets wet with my tears!
961	v765	\N	1	Seika-sama has identified you as Tanaka... It is therefore your duty to change your name to Tanaka Funyatarou or something.
962	v16560	\N	3	Thank you very much, Super-beautiful big-breasted onee-san!
963	v12794	\N	1	If you're about to die, why do you care who I am? Clearly, you're not serious about this at all.
965	v238	\N	1	What's this?.....This.....fluffy bunch?
966	v18498	c40662	3	Yes, it is. There's no doubt about it. The entire universe would implode, and all because of your failure to use contraception, Setsuna-san.

1003	v66	\N	2	We have no allies. No one will help us. We have to protect ourselves, by ourselves.
1004	v414	\N	1	So this mother fucker costumer wants a fuckin' beer, right?
1005	v548	c22060	11	My plan was to render her speechless with my manliness, then stride off into the darkness without turning back, all victorious-like.

1044	v1155	\N	5	This is bad, I'm pretty sure his game folder contains lots of games about little sisters.
1045	v8158	\N	4	Don't demean yourself. You have plenty to offer, like... plenty to offer
1046	v23428	\N	2	Oi, whore, what about I put some concrete inside your pussy?
1047	v5136	\N	4	I hated her ! Whooo !! Wanted to murder it !! Whooo !!

1062	v23281	\N	2	Okay, so like... I've been thinking! And no, that is not your cue for a mean joke about me being dumb, got it?

1076	v2153	\N	6	......I won't say anything perverted, so keep your hands off my ass.

1092	v7014	\N	4	Meaningless death just gets me all giddy inside! Reminds me that things could be worse!
1093	v21852	\N	3	My three options were to lose an arm, be locked up, or become her friend.

1109	v21261	\N	1	You don't need to know how to swing to get through life, so whatever. Also, a little bit of clumsiness makes me cuter.
1110	v5943	\N	3	Yes. My favorite game genre is galge and eroge. Or more like, I almost don't play anything else.
1111	v548	\N	5	How come I'm not the protagonist? This casting choice sucks.

1126	v68	\N	11	...It's good to be a doctor... because I get to touch the skin of young people many times, and I can turn them into my slaves with a little injection...

1131	v17	\N	5	Naturally, I knows the hacker
1132	v10680	\N	4	Shut up, you Swiss. Go donate all of your blood 'til you die.
1133	v7723	\N	6	That is not true. Modern rice cookers can record television over the internet.
1134	v15538	\N	1	Uh, "Meow. What's up?" isn't the answer I'm looking for...
1135	v20330	c55337	7	No... She isn't under eighteen... It doesn't show, but I can feel it.
1136	v20	\N	9	I was about to die, but it wasn't a big deal.
1137	v751	c304	20	That's right. You are a shithead. You are Mister Shit. The shit controls you. In fact, you are nothing but shit.
1138	v700	\N	2	The finishing move would be the Super Ultra Wonderful Maximum Eccentric Grande Hyper Wonderful Sweet Time Service Mighty Bomb!
1139	v436	\N	11	GOOOOOOOOOOD!!! If I'd known this was going to happen, I would've raped you last night!!!
1140	v7	\N	29	Dead people can't be alive!
1141	v88	\N	3	As punishment, I had to complete a redemption assignment. It was specifically designed to make suicide seem like an attractive alternative.
1142	v10304	c18175	6	Do you want to take a look at the toilet I just used this much?
1143	v7184	\N	2	Gravity is love, you know.
1144	v715	\N	11	Let's go let her whip us, Mr. Nick!
1145	v515	\N	5	I was a patron of that dismembered slut over there.

1147	v7723	\N	4	I've taught you how to eat your food, shoot a gun and handle a woman. You can do the rest by yourself, right?

1174	v103	\N	5	Then I had the following sequence of thoughts: (1) man, this is weird; (2) hmm, I certainly didn't build that fire; (3) so she must have; (4) man, this is weird.
1176	v700	\N	1	Installing can be very painful. But, it could bring happiness if a partner installs with love.

1187	v3766	\N	6	Aan... In my Hapsburg... Shuichi, put your manly Baskville in my dirty Hapsburg!
1188	v28253	\N	2	Just like every cultured person, I think the only good Englishman is a dead Englishman.
1189	v4017	\N	7	Busy? BUSY?! What could possibly be more important than strip-mahjong?!

1209	v5883	c36546	8	If I tell him that I'll step on him, he'll do anything.
1210	v914	\N	7	Let's all take a bath together! Let's strengthen our bonds by socializing naked!
1211	v21552	\N	4	But needle-less to say, I'm bad at sewing.
1213	v5154	\N	18	I very nearly took out my cell phone and tweeted 'The rain in Spain falls mainly on my lady jane #wet.
1214	v17018	\N	11	Just a quick disclaimer here: I have no interest in men.
1215	v20148	\N	3	Trust a gamer to set his life on hard mode!
1216	v27519	\N	5	Can we step away from committing seppuku tonight...?!
1220	v933	\N	1	Oh, but you would. Let me tell you, three years and eight months ago, I didn't eat that curry yogurt they had on sale, and I regret it so much to this day! Believe me you
1221	v933	\N	5	That's phil-o-sophical! A very filosophical question! Hm, yes, very deep, quite profound! You're stupid, but that question wasn't bad at all!
1222	v2632	\N	8	I... I never knew the bathroom ghost with the terrifying voice could have such a sad backstory!
1223	v7809	\N	4	Okay, okay, okay. So it's a story about poor Mr. Schrödinger and his beloved cat, right?
1226	v7809	\N	5	Wait...why does she smell like...old people and booze...?
1227	v7809	\N	5	Did you think it was a nipple with two hairs growing out of it?
1229	v7809	\N	7	Lemme be straight with you: Your shit is wack. Like, hella wack.
1230	v7809	\N	4	Why the hell would you hide a diary in your crotch?!
1231	v7809	\N	5	Ha! Now that's funny. You must've done a lot of drugs to look like that at twenty-two.
1232	v26553	\N	1	If I wanted to get blue-collared the hard way, I'd borrow Jasmynn's jean short-shorts and stand assumingly around the motel.
1233	v26553	\N	1	I thought about trolling, y'know, and writing 'I EAT THE BABY' and hopping up and down on the crib, but I don't know...
1234	v26553	\N	1	If someone comes running at me with a syringe, I'm using you as a meat-shield.
1235	v26553	\N	1	My parents sell fucking ice cream! How can you hate the ice cream family?!
1236	v26553	\N	1	Are you saying I have a gay face?
1237	v26553	\N	1	Yo Maria, what the fuck... don't pour booze on the Rape-Ghost. We honor our... our dead bad-touchers on this night.
1238	v22692	\N	2	By the way, I'm a shemale, and I have a really big cock.
1239	v22692	\N	2	Don't worry, I respect for your virgin ass.
1240	v22692	\N	2	it seems to me that my cock is full cum! <3
1241	v44	\N	10	I imagine what those bitches would sound like if they were tortured by the Spanish Inquisition.
1242	v4	\N	14	Look at the Old Testament! It was Eve who caused Adam's fall! A woman!
1243	v4	\N	31	YOU'RE STILL TEN YEARS TOO EARLY TO LOOK AT MY DAUGHTER'S ASS!
1244	v33	\N	7	It may be embarrassing at first... but when when you get used to it there's no better way to know someone than socializing nude.
1245	v33	\N	7	Look, marriage isn't all like 'oooh, romantic'. It's just drudgery and then divorce.
1246	v33	\N	6	I'm going to kick your ass so hard it'll tear you in half.... later.
1247	v34090	\N	2	But what about the dodos?
1248	v43470	c124874	5	We're clearly not going to blow up the elevator! Let's rethink this!
1249	v43470	c124875	5	Stop, the microwave kid's obviously not going to sacrifice themself. Their body's far too scrawny to contain any sort of blast.
1250	v24110	\N	5	I see a criminal, I punch. Gotta stop 'em running somehow.
1251	v24110	\N	3	Jeez, we're grown men. We've outgrown the concept of "friends."
1252	v24110	\N	7	I made my peace with being hated in order to get shit done.
1253	v24110	\N	4	I talk so much shit, it's hard to remember all of it.
1254	v24110	\N	4	Yes, stimulation. I crave it. Murder, theft. The good stuff.
1255	v1281	\N	5	Cancelling Christmas got cancelled, so I reinstated Christmas.
1256	v1281	\N	3	Well, I just thought that I wanted to become your boiled egg.
1257	v417	\N	1	Only you are going to Hell. Oh, how I envy you.
1258	v17018	\N	14	I like busty women in their late forties with huge asses.
1259	v8158	\N	5	Heheh... I'm starting to get turned on from handing out flyers these days
1260	v8158	\N	3	How many monster trucks does it take to hold all your love?
1261	v8158	\N	4	Don't you 'hello' me, you boob beast.
1262	v8158	\N	3	You two get along too well. It reminds me of how single I am.
1263	v8158	\N	5	Reality is so unrealistic. We all lost to a guy in drag.
1264	v8158	\N	3	Is anyone going to retort to that first part? Or do they all think I'm on the sex offender registry?
1265	v16714	c40686	2	Fuck your mother... Oh, I see. No one even wants to fuck your mother, and your daddy's busy fucking some other woman.
1266	v16714	c40692	1	We're always doing the wrong things... how are we going to tell the kids that to be a grown up is a thing to be proud of?
1268	v16714	c40686	1	If we pay a lot of money, could we change the baby into a girl?
1269	v16714	c40687	1	She once made a dinosaur from a milk carton. It looked good, though.
1270	v16714	c40687	2	The attendance sheet is chaotic. And errors just keep popping out of the latest Windows 95...
1271	v16714	c40687	1	Blood turns the river scarlet.
1272	v16714	c40687	2	Ashes to ashes, dust to dust.
1273	v16714	c40692	1	Children often go astray, not because of bad nature, but because of lack of recognition with love.
1274	v16714	c40688	1	What kind of father would let his girl wander around without a circumcision?!
1275	v16714	c40687	1	Heaven without the others is in fact, hell of loneliness. ...We became humans because we were afraid of being alone from the start.
1280	v16714	c40686	1	I had to grow to the point where people would listen to me and my words would be given value.
1281	v16714	c40686	1	I am willing to be that side, I am willing to pay forgiveness first, in order for one day, I can be fairly recognized.
1282	v16714	c40694	1	I'm not hated by others, they don't deserve to hate me, it was me who hated them in the first place.
1283	v16714	c40687	1	Thinking about it carefully, the survival skills we really need in life are really not learned in school.
1284	v43470	c124885	3	Y'know, red wire, blue wire, you gotta cut one! Like the movies!
1285	v43470	c124875	8	Call me crazy, but perhaps fire and explosives shouldn't mix.
1286	v43470	c124873	1	So you think this egg is just cranky and needs a nap?
1287	v43470	c124885	4	Everyone's always mad at the idea guy.
1289	v43470	c124876	3	Teardrops in the spring, can you hear me sing? La la la la, dee dee dee dee.
1290	v43470	c124876	7	Locomotive in motion. I think I lost my lotion. The window shows the ocean. Oh wait, there's my lotion.
1291	v43470	c124876	3	My starved stomach babbled, though I ignore my grumbling tummy. For the eggs I recieved are scrambled, when I asked for my eggs sunny.
1292	v13325	\N	4	Whoa whoa?! Nii-san? Why do you exist?!
1293	v22505	\N	10	As far as I was concerned, they were the stupid ones for going to school every day. Try thinking for yourself for once, dipshits.
1294	v22505	\N	17	F-F-FLAG TRIIIIIIIIPPED!1!1!!
1295	v22505	\N	23	In the heat of the moment, I'd given a serious, non-shitpost response.
1296	v22505	\N	1	I don't give a damn about your salvation.
1297	v22505	\N	13	Hmm, was this girl not actually 3D? A girl this cute couldn't be 3D!
1298	v22505	\N	1	But compared to the usual girl who glared at everyone and everything... the girl whose weakness was on display right now... was far more beautiful.
1299	v22505	\N	28	A N O T H E R F U C K I N G M E N T A L C A S E ? A N O T H E R G O D D A M N C H U U N I B Y O U ?
1300	v22505	\N	21	I see a woman walking down the street? I imagine the whore naked! That's who I really am!
1301	v22505	\N	3	That's who I am! I won't let other people like you decide who I am! I'll decide what I really am!
1302	v22505	\N	2	I'm not your toy! I'm not some circus freak!
1303	v22505	\N	15	I exist.
1304	v22505	\N	17	Can't say I'm all that fond of tentacle porn, though.
1306	v17101	\N	5	It was like God was doing a little trolling.
1307	v17101	\N	3	Was fate itself trolling me?
1308	v17101	\N	5	I am the captain of my soul. And you of yours. We will prove that!
1310	v1299	c73540	1	Every single bee's a light.
1311	v548	\N	4	You make me sick, you piece of shit. How dare you copy my hair color...
1313	v11033	\N	2	Uhm, I guess we're discussing the infinite stupidity of males?
1314	v11033	\N	1	Confidence and honesty were good things, but he could do with a little less of both.
1316	v11033	\N	2	You're not anyone's possession. Your body and soul are mine, but your will is your own. You're not a slave or a machine.
1317	v11033	\N	1	It was an area without area. A world not of this world.
1318	v11033	\N	4	Nikola Tesla. 72 years old. I'm a transfer student.
1320	v11033	\N	3	Just make sure you don't get yourself killed. Nobody gets away with dropping out for lack of a pulse on my watch.
1321	v11033	\N	4	When your eyes are fixed on the horizon, it's easy to overlook the obstacles in your path.
1323	v11033	\N	5	Perhaps an enormous secret society is keeping me under constant observation, and furtively thwarts my attempts at finding love. A compelling theory, don't you think?
1324	v44	\N	2	...So you're not giving me your semen?
1325	v139	\N	8	Oh, crap... I got a boner from looking at another guy...
1326	v42910	\N	2	I got the face! I got the look! I got the charisma! Just let me seduce the dragon!
1329	v38927	\N	4	Maybe killing people is actually fun!... I don't know yet!
1330	v38927	\N	1	It's almost like she's proud of me for being a greedy asshole.
1331	v38927	\N	1	How am I supposed to clean? Shoot at dirty things?
1333	v30190	\N	2	She must really like you! I haven't seen her flustered since she was in the middle school and she peed her-
1334	v30190	\N	5	My brother likes boys AND girls, actually. He's.. uh... Bisectional?
1335	v30190	\N	1	If I hate you, what does it matter if I'm attracted to you or not?
1336	v30190	\N	3	My mom bathing me in the blood of other infants for the first couple of months of my life is far from natural.
1337	v30190	\N	2	That's very sweet of you, but weren't we going to make out?
1339	v11853	\N	2	No offense, Claire, but isn't it your job to know when you're being screwed?
1340	v11853	\N	4	When I was a little girl, I wanted to be an astronaut. Unfortunately, a crushed spine has a way of changing your career plans.
1341	v11853	\N	2	I'm used to dealing with people who think I'm taking advantage of my clients. Which I am. But that's besides the point.
1342	v8620	\N	2	And I love the taste of young boys after a long journey!
1343	v19237	\N	2	I refuse to try my appendix again. I don't even know what an appendix is.
1344	v19237	\N	1	Wonder if size matters for these things. Cause, like, I'm not going to be as good of a butt mage anymore.
1345	v19237	\N	1	Sword! I need your help, what is a- uh- a penis supposed to look like?!
1347	v19237	\N	2	Have you had sexy times yet? Can... can lesbians have sexy times?
1348	v19237	\N	3	So you're claiming to be good at magic because... you're autistic?
1349	v19237	\N	2	Apparently hair length is not an indicator of sexuality. Who knew? I'll make a note.
1350	v19237	\N	2	I'm not even into women and I found the first part strangery erotic, but the moment you get to disembowelment? I'm NOT going to take your organs.
1351	v19237	\N	4	But I like boys. I have a tendency for liking GAY boys admittedly, but that's just bad luck!
1352	v30618	\N	1	Miss ladder legs doesn't even need a bra. You flat bitches save so much money, you know that?
1353	v1474	\N	4	Then maybe you could become a telescope in the future.
1354	v29647	\N	5	There's a huge difference between wanting to sleep with a man and wanting to sleep with his own brother, okay?
1355	v29647	\N	3	Is it weird to think of your own younger brother when being confessed to by a cute girl?
1356	v22505	\N	7	How would I get my hands on milk with Shibuya like this...?
1357	v15	\N	2	Yesterday, I think I killed him, but I have a wonderful boyfriend.
1358	v51	c4766	8	Uunn... let me sleep for just three more inches...
1359	v51	c4766	3	You're okay with a 'Giant Nice Burger with Garlic', aren't you?
1361	v28481	\N	6	YEAH!! Pulling some strings with the other classes was worth it! Nepotism wins!!
1362	v16032	\N	12	So you just AGREED?! How slutty are you?! Girls in PORN GAMES are more chaste that you! You goddamn nymphoslut!
1363	v16032	\N	12	Oh, don't worry. Violence is VERY feminine.
1364	v19397	\N	8	Ulrik... Pasta is a deeply sexual dish.
1365	v20728	\N	6	You pervert. Go back inside and content yourself with carrots or something.
1366	v7402	\N	1	Wasn't rape. He had the pillow's consent.
1367	v5154	\N	5	Perhaps we should put a price on the head of those habitually cornflake-crunching "cereal" killers?
1368	v4	\N	23	Oh, no! I forgot the boobs I need for my next class!
1369	v26796	\N	2	I'll see you again in 100 years. No, make that a 1,000
1370	v26796	\N	2	I'm not into painful activities. S-So...go easy on me.
1371	v29443	\N	7	Ok, got it. But since it's my booty, I'll do as I like.
1372	v29443	\N	8	What dark web image board did you get all that from?
1373	v19829	c60020	27	Did she just... teleport away the jizz I pumped into her?
1374	v22899	\N	12	Having sex doesn't necessarily mean you lose your virginity.
1375	v19829	\N	1	Okay, you're making me feel old. Go on, leave.
1376	v19829	\N	2	Seriously? What, you think she's straight out of a porn game?
1378	v29443	\N	9	Why didn't my creator give me a switch to cease myself?
1379	v7445	\N	4	The school has been... stolen...
1380	v7445	\N	1	So we just have to look for an old man wearing a silk hat with a lot of muscles
1381	v124	\N	8	What a small one you have. It must be easy to pee with that.
1382	v21552	c98137	2	Don't you think it'd be better if he started off by fooling around with a shitty, level-one-slime kind of girl?
1383	v21552	c65184	3	Incidentally, I'm in the little sister Yumi-chan's route right now. She always comes to wake you up with an ahegao.
1384	v21552	c65184	1	He just doesn't understand the appeal of the chaotic world of 24/7 ahegao like I do.
1385	v21552	c65184	1	Everyone's entitled to their own opinions, but I honestly can't stand people who use their experience as an excuse to say whatever the hell they want.
1386	v21552	c65184	5	I ahegao.
1387	v21552	c98138	5	Fine, be like that! Next time I take a shit, I'm gonna make sure not to flush just to spite you all.
1388	v21552	c65184	2	I'm an elite ero gamer who seeks only the most beautiful of romances. I wouldn't dare do something as stupid as going to a hotel with someone I just met.
1389	v21552	c98137	3	You know, even gross dogs like him become lovable once you marry them. You grow attached after a while.
1390	v21552	c65184	5	Calling yourself flat-chested when you've got huge tits is a power move. I respect that.
1391	v21552	c65184	3	Don't give my dick another man's name!
1392	v21552	c65184	4	(Uh, no, I'm pretty sure threesomes aren't a topic for mothers to bring up with their daughters!)
1393	v21552	c65184	2	If a bunch of my shadow clones sexually harassed you, it'd end in bloodshed.
1394	v21552	\N	1	Of course. All my life, I've been raised to reflexively call things cute.
1395	v21552	c62889	1	Father! Please entrust me with your son!!
1399	v21552	\N	3	Why am I acting out a love triangle between salami and kielbasa?
1400	v21552	c65184	4	Y-You can count on me. I'll buy you a whole country or two.
1401	v21552	c65184	4	I'm such an ultra monogamist that I refuse to even touch harem games.
1402	v21552	c65184	1	I can't be assed to, so I shake my ass. Ass-shaking is now my exclusive means of declaring my intent.
1404	v21552	c65184	2	You suck. Put some more heart into it. Discover your inner cicada.
1405	v22594	\N	2	Assign skill points to her nipples ♪
1406	v22594	c62891	4	Aight, let's make her a max nipple dexterity build.
1407	v22594	c65184	6	On multiple occasions, my Mom burst out laughing when walking in on me crying to a nakige sex scene with my dick out.
1408	v22594	c62890	5	Look, I've even got a fart-detecting app! You've farted in front of me 27 times this month alone!
1409	v22594	\N	1	I need to marry a man who flings his socks on the floor, too...
1410	v22594	\N	4	The bastard's just a lobster, and yet he's cumming...
1411	v22594	\N	1	My rice grains reverse causality, creating the result of being stuck on your face first.
1412	v22304	\N	5	Huh? What are you talking about? Why would sharks be in a tornado?!
1413	v22304	c66524	1	Emily had the pleased look of a villain who had just found the hero's biggest weakness. How rude...
1414	v22304	\N	1	Ahh... I suppose the older you get, the less noticeable you become...
1415	v21438	c22768	6	Hey, Masaya, which mountain shall we take on next? There are some I've never liked the look of.
1416	v21438	c22771	11	Get your minds out of the gutter. You can't tell someone's sexual preference from an FC match.
1417	v21438	c22771	9	How messed up would our relationship have to be for me to show my love for you by kissing your shoes?
1418	v21438	c22771	6	Maybe it's time to form the Church of Tobisawa.
1419	v1474	c3907	5	Onii-chan's gone berserk with the chainsaw?!
1420	v1474	c3882	1	Yes! My plan to show Chinami's weirdness in order to make me look normal has succeeded!
1422	v1474	c3882	1	......Though I'll be perturbed if a maid cafe did actually serve turtles.
1424	v1474	c3939	8	The result for the divination states that you're a tsundere.
1425	v1474	\N	2	You're sad because you were born, right?
1426	v1474	c3907	3	This Chinami that isn't Chinami, isn't Chinami! The Chinami in front of Onii-chan is the real Chinami!
1427	v1474	c3907	1	Onii-chan, can Chinami become a maid again to buy a telescope for observing UFOs?
1428	v1474	c3932	1	B-Be quiet! You're supposed to respond with a "hai" or "yes"!
1429	v1474	\N	3	I'm sure there are virtuous slimes too.
1430	v1474	c3907	3	Isn't that a little mean to someone who hasn't had any screentime lately, Onii-chan?!
1431	v1474	c3882	1	That's because she's a nuclear warhead.
1432	v1474	\N	4	In the end, it's all about the slimes, huh......?
1433	v1474	c6161	5	I...... have a fetish for lost causes......
1435	v1474	c6158	2	Because my little sister was abducted by aliens.
1436	v1474	c3907	1	Yep. We've been confirming whether the Grim Reaper of Love was an alien or not every day.
1437	v1474	c3882	2	High-quality charcoal has appeared in the frying pan.
1439	v2959	c3882	3	Chinami taught me all about the dangers of doing alchemy in the kitchen.
1440	v2959	c3882	1	In summary, you want me to use a yoyo to pull you in, instead of putting my arms around you.
1441	v16150	c54840	1	I promised to always be by your side, Mistress. Even if you need to powder your nose.
1442	v16150	c23345	2	I-I did not. Didn't you introduce yourself? You said, 'I'm Youhei, the train molester'.
1443	v16150	c23346	2	But you have this super serious aura around you right now... Normally, you've got more of a horny aura, you know.
1444	v16150	c54840	1	I'm not a damn towel for you to wring out!
1445	v16150	c54840	3	Sure, I'll molest you gently.
1446	v31007	c97201	1	Oh. You have a pet island?
1447	v31007	c97202	1	Hold on a moment. What is the definition of a lolicon in the first place?
1448	v31007	c97201	1	So that means that... age is not a factor to determine who is a lolicon.
1449	v31007	c97202	2	Does that mean that a twenty-year-old guy who is attracted to a young-looking thirty-year-old woman is a lolicon?
1450	v19125	c46812	4	Um... According to this report, that meteorite came down in Russian waters, just as NYASA predicted.
1451	v19125	c46811	2	Yep, you just started feeding rice porridge to an alien, and one made out of metal at that!
1452	v19125	c46810	3	Well, you know, R-ne was originally some kind of liquid, right? So he said he took the first letter of the word 'liquid,' R.
1454	v19125	\N	2	When you put it like that, you make it sound like those bizarre festivals where you throw tomatoes at each other, or get chased by bulls.
1455	v19125	c46811	3	That's a pro for you. Never forgetting that meow, regardless of situation.
1457	v19125	c46813	3	Gwahahaha! Boobs determine your status as a woman. The bigger they are, the more valuable you are! So make sure to treasure them!
1458	v19125	c48677	3	FOLLOW MY LEAD AND EXCRETE, HUMAN.
1459	v19125	\N	2	Why!? Why don't you understand how avant-garde it is, wearing a school swimsuit in space!? Is it just a generation gap!?
1461	v11093	c22896	3	Good, you didn't bring contraceptives.
1462	v16212	c22896	5	Hmm, that was a bit rude. To the dandelions, I mean. They seem to be more capable of intelligent thought than you.
1463	v16212	\N	5	This sounds familiar. It's like you keep saving up this super amazing potion in a game only to clear it without ever using it.
1464	v31002	\N	3	Hey, I know this guy! This is Gokyu from Dragon's Soul, right?
1465	v31002	c97050	2	Er, just so you know, boners go away on their own after a while.
1467	v31002	\N	3	Sh-She's right! In 99.9% of the manga you read, there's always at least one scene where a boy gives a girl a stuffed animal he won at a crane game!
1468	v31002	c97050	3	I never thought I'd get shot for making a joke...
1469	v31002	c97056	5	That's right... Maybe you've even found yourself a girlfriend, despite having me, your little sister, already...
1470	v31002	c97056	3	......So you prefer your sister's friend over your own sister. I see.
1471	v31002	\N	3	Well, since you're the protagonist, can't you just deepen your relationship by looking at her panties or something?
1472	v31002	c97050	2	And at the risk of repeating myself, I wasn't the main character in some goofy love story.
1473	v31002	c97056	3	At least I get to soak in his leftover bathwater! I'll settle for that.
1475	v1143	c3885	21	Hey, hey. We're all over 18 because of the will of the universe.
1476	v211	\N	3	To exaggerate a bit, it's like you can't even do a Hadouken, but you're really good with the Shoryuken...!
1479	v5	\N	11	There it is! The sword art he obtained by suppressing all the sexual urges of his adolescence!
1480	v5	c201	11	You must use the cat to fight.
1481	v5	c192	34	I envy you, Masato. Your answer to the question 'What happened in 1853?' was 'A war broke out between Mars and Earth.'
1482	v5	c1864	14	No, no, Anego is Anego, that's why Anego.
1483	v5	c192	9	The very fact that you think of yourself and your muscles as seperate entities is amazing...
1484	v5	c192	14	Cat society sure is tough...
1485	v5	c201	9	The old woman was engaged in a deathly battle with Tentaclus by the riverside...
1486	v5	c193	25	I finally mastered my role as a tree, dammit!
1487	v5	\N	15	Living is, after all, losing.
1488	v5	c192	16	I got kicked out of my room by a cat...
1489	v8158	c9360	2	I feel the great disturbance of a farce. As if millions of books cried out in terror, and were suddenly silenced.
1490	v14269	c17415	5	Mom and Dad weren't around most of the time since they were busy with their jobs, so sometimes we forgot they existed.
1491	v13631	c17297	6	...You may be a maiden, but there are some things even I won't tolerate. How dare you call my quest for beauty 'molestation'?! How rude!
1492	v26414	c85057	4	Now it just sounds like she's charging a kamehameha or something.
1493	v26414	c85055	5	I get that you're passionate about this sort of thing, but I don't think it's a good idea to go ranting about porn to your girlfriend.
1495	v893	c92947	5	Yeah. The Anman War, caused by one girl's refusal to concede a single anman to the aliens.
1496	v71	\N	5	All right! I'll take your Genghis Khan virginity!
1497	v248	\N	5	Shalom!!
1498	v66	\N	16	Not Cross Channel. It should be CROSS†CHANNEL.
1499	v5154	\N	1	Uhm... am I perhaps going to be raped in the immediate future?
1500	v22899	\N	8	Damm, bro, you landed a slut after all! The legendary loli slut! Look at that adorable yet subtly enticing smile! I can't fucking handle this, man!
1501	v945	\N	12	So that was pretty much it. It's a murder mystery without a murder.
1502	v27227	\N	2	I'm infinitely more comfortable with this type of work than becoming friends with a girl.
1503	v5316	\N	1	Alright, Titty Team! We're leaving!! A true gentleman doesn't get in the way of a man and his lady!
1505	v14267	\N	4	Even when I turn to hide my reddening face and body, an unsuspecting butt enters my field of vision.
1506	v1377	\N	2	(I-Isn't a kiss a sacred exchange that comes forth from mutual consent?)
1507	v1377	\N	3	It'd be pretty stupid if I ended up endangering her out of a silly sense of morality.
1508	v1377	\N	1	Despite my appearance, I'll have you know that I'm a science girl.
1509	v1377	\N	7	Her soft walls wrapped themselves around my dick, increasing the coefficient of pleasurable friction μ.
1510	v32984	\N	4	In a few hours, I'll be banging someone who tortures people and keeps high-school girls captive as a side hobby.
1511	v21269	\N	11	Why did a guy who was grossed out by a damn centipede decide to touch my dick with his bare heands?
1512	v21269	\N	3	He was right. Who among us was showing our true selves?
1513	v39815	\N	4	Don't look at her breasts. Don't look at her breasts. **Don't look at her breasts. Don't look at her breasts. Don't look at her breasts.**
1514	v39815	\N	1	"My apologies if I was being a little bit aggressive back there... I had an encounter with these demons once." "And what happened?" "Trauma."
1515	v7803	\N	8	Why would Ikki going to the beach with a time traveler from the French Revolution strike any kind of jealous emotion in me?  الا
1516	v18160	\N	11	(I-I made him cry emoji tears...)
1517	v18160	\N	10	Don't call me an amoeba, seaweed head.  I'll boil you in miso soup and eat you.
1518	v18690	\N	10	Are you sure? Don't you have a huge dick from all that time you spent in America?
1519	v12396	\N	10	Dear warrior, your arms are like the thickest banana in the world. Oh my hero...
1520	v3144	\N	73	This is a technique that was frequently used by my old friend, Adolf Hitler.
1521	v28633	\N	8	She just casually throws around a phrase as cryptic as "childhood friend condom. "
1522	v26375	\N	4	On beautiful moonlit nights like this... you can meet angels.
1523	v26375	\N	1	Shut up and let me beat you!
1524	v66	\N	2	Damnit! My sperm got taken out.
1525	v66	\N	10	Do people give fellatios at your house when they deliver bentos?
1526	v66	\N	1	"The Love Aristocrat's Autograph" cannot be discarded
1528	v18131	c39202	8	Fan service is an important part of the job as an engineer, Sotetsu-sama.
1529	v9879	\N	13	Uh, next is... English. Dammit. English wouldn't be a thing anymore if I killed all Americans.
1530	v5316	\N	2	It almost feels like the whole reason she wanted to unify the country was so our group could get back together and eat cake
1531	v6540	\N	7	So shit out your diarrhea in front of me while you babble like a baby.
1532	v18381	\N	4	They say the desert does weird things to your head. Or maybe Wisconsin does.
1533	v2153	\N	14	I'm all for gender equality. If someone's a waste of space, I'll smack 'em no matter who they are.
1534	v1474	c3910	3	Our astro club sleepover is seriously gonna turn into a lesbo slumber party at this rate
1536	v31807	\N	2	And then I died anyway! So much for that!
1538	v10016	\N	3	I never thought I'd get to be this intimate with a cat. Hehe, hehehe.
1541	v21552	\N	7	Oh no. For the very first time, I feel like committing violence against a child.
1542	v66	\N	12	I am a gentleman so I don't need to bathe.
1543	v2016	\N	28	(There's a four thousand year old Egyptian wall painting that simply says "kids these days.")
1544	v1143	\N	5	I swear by my charm that I will give you a boner!
1545	v3111	\N	4	I'm more interested in that bread than your thighs
1546	v432	\N	6	There is no definition. An idiot is an idiot.
1547	v599	\N	7	So, Onii-San, were you here for that kinda sorta gay movie they showed the other day?
1548	v933	\N	3	I'll go with the boobs.
1549	v28823	\N	4	I want to ask "what the hell is wrong with you" but I know better than to question royalty.
1550	v22899	\N	12	I WILL NEVER! EVER! FUUUUUUUUUCK!!!
1551	v16044	c26598	8	But what I love are sushi balls! I just want to shove those tasty ballls into my mouth whenever I see them.
1552	v16044	\N	3	I mean, I've never seen any manboobs like those.
1553	v7721	\N	1	I had a bad feeling about this from the start. This guy's planning on putting me to work.
1554	v22899	\N	5	Then let me have some of that! Refusal of sex is a violation of my right to free obscenity!
1555	v22899	\N	3	Has the thought ever occurred to you that the very idea of solving love problems with eroge is stupid in the first place.
1556	v32855	\N	3	What am I, an energy drink?
1557	v28439	\N	3	It's hard to be "cute"★
1558	v5047	\N	3	I do admit that I was inside the locker in the women's locker room with a cactus pot in my hands.
1559	v1474	c3938	1	The S must supply the love, so that the M can receive her happiness.
1560	v31469	\N	9	Yooou're~ waaatching~ too~ muuuch~ pooorn~...
1561	v20448	\N	6	Is this my destiny as the god of molestation... no...
1562	v19035	\N	25	I'm amazed I actually asked you to watch me cut my own dick off with a knife.
1563	v16044	c41324	5	I put my shame behind me and begin my new life as a bassist.
1564	v26639	c85635	1	Yeah-- you're the one that kicked the hornet's nest... nah wait, wouldn't it be the hamster's nest in this case? Eh, whatever.
1565	v47242	\N	1	I'm surprised that he hasn't pissed his pants after seeing his own shadow.
1566	v24888	\N	3	You know, there are plenty of people who mistake a mountain's deity commute back home for a suicide attempt.
1568	v22603	\N	5	C-Come on! If you like what you see so much, go and violate your sister already!
1570	v44358	\N	5	For a week it'd be kinda fun. You wanna be sexed-up abusive lesbians?
1572	v20448	\N	6	I mean, to begin with, this stage is not even NTR yet, just mob humiliation. In other words, it's the furthest thing from my proclivities and interests!
1573	v48041	\N	1	The age of waifus is upon us.
1574	v10694	\N	9	Do ghosts wear pants?
1576	v3144	\N	54	Hehehe... I'm a yandere... I'm crazy, depressed, and autistic.
1577	v3144	\N	54	My life is masturbation. Total masturbation. I revolve and accelerate, my hand in my pants the whole time. I’m a ballerina dancing through the world.
1578	v3144	\N	18	I am vulgarity itself.
1579	v3746	\N	5	While happy, I can't exactly let my real sister play a game where the goal is to screw your younger sister.
1580	v31544	\N	3	Mushrooms aren't very poggers.
1581	v31544	\N	6	Did you ever watch Twink Peaks?
1583	v18157	\N	5	Well, if the tulpa's giving good head, there's not much to complain about.
1584	v32274	\N	4	Why would you say "hwuh" when you've been thrown out of a window? At least say "eep" or something.
1585	v32274	\N	4	But this is a no "this is a 'no buts' situation" situation kind of but.
1586	v29345	c97865	6	What I know is we live in cul-de-sacs and you don't have to sell crack when you live in a cul-de-sac!
1587	v10694	\N	10	I'm really interested in sex between men, because it never happens.
1589	v18760	c61599	9	You fucking piece of shit, let's see if you can say that again with my dick in your ass.
1592	v16150	\N	1	My boobs exist to be seen by my onii-chan!
1593	v19769	\N	4	Sorry about this carnivorous girl and her insatiable need for physical contact.
1594	v10694	\N	7	Make no mistake, it's individuality! Even asses have their own individuality!
1595	v10694	\N	5	Paa. What are you, hemorrhoids?
1596	v18806	\N	5	The scene where the voice of "You talkin' to me" playing from the tape vividly appears in my mind lifts my spirits.
1597	v18806	\N	1	I crossed a line that I shouldn't cross and became a resident on the other side of the border.
1598	v18806	\N	5	This woman also pisses! I bet she poops too!
1599	v18806	\N	7	I don't have time to find out if she's a virgin or where her hymen is!!
1600	v18806	\N	5	She was a beautiful girl, and I thought she was beautiful even down to her butthole.
1601	v18152	\N	10	I ramble on, wowing her with my extensive knowledge of default PC wallpapers.
1603	v11	\N	4	I wanted to leave you two, since you made a rather ugly pair as abandoned children go
1604	v11	\N	25	I think alarm clocks are degenerate
1607	v2016	\N	5	I am a fool, and folly is my nature. If the wise path brings only regret, then I'll give myself to madness and laugh all the way to hell
1608	v2016	\N	11	Sure, I'll tell you anything you want, from my bust size to my favorite position, after I 've dealth with arachnocunt here
1609	v2016	\N	1	That's right! I'm the big cheese here! Now let me see you grovel, peasant!
1610	v2016	\N	3	Actually, I happend to enjoy the terror. Nothing quite like the feel of urine dribbling down your leg.
1611	v2016	\N	5	This guy is a gift who keeps on giving! If there's a record for most pissed-off motherfucker on earth, I'm about to break it
1612	v2016	\N	23	It's true Ichijo. The world is filled with untold wonders. I believe it is called a bikini.
1615	v21281	\N	10	A world of man-to-man relationships = birthrate plummets = the world is destroyed ＼(^o^)／
1616	v18149	\N	12	I need you to obtain the wisdom of post-nut clarity. To that end, I will be wringing out your semen until your balls are empty.
1618	v67	\N	15	In times where you must accept your gay side, just imagine that you're a maid on the receiving end of some strict "disciplining."
1620	v22899	c71526	10	Be quiet! I'm rubbing your ass.
1621	v18149	\N	9	Turns out heaven isn't above the clouds. It was inside of the female body all along.
1622	v17872	\N	5	I don’t see her as a woman anyway, so it doesn’t matter to me whether she is on her period or not
1623	v45007	\N	4	The toilet has an almost threatening aura...
1624	v22899	c71526	20	Dammit, I gave up my ass virginity for this!?
1626	v40963	c121368	3	KFC's chicken might not grant you everlasting life, but it's the only thing on this rotten, miserable little space rock that comes close to it!
1627	v40963	c121375	1	KFC is very important, after all.
1630	v47276	\N	2	Jesus, I feel like I'm jerking off a snake-
1631	v22053	c125488	3	IT HURTS so much!! MY HEAD will explod... nice boobs... AARRGG!
1634	v44	\N	3	Y, You dick! Who ejaculates in a girl's mouth all of a sudden like that!
1635	v44	\N	8	Shit, I'm really badly hurt. I've got a level 3 porn game infection.
1636	v26532	\N	8	Look, a porno mag on the floor!
1637	v12167	\N	3	If both arms were broken, then would you let me feed you?
1638	v26581	c85517	4	Sausage? Is that was those long, thick things are called?
1639	v31324	c125013	4	There are no doubts! The person who took the spring onions was Hatsune Miku-san!
1641	v39613	c124532	2	I don't have any sort of backstory where I was hit by a truck, you know?
1645	v28556	c91064	5	Nn... It IS more authentic when it's not dubbed!
1646	v32603	c100682	1	I may be broke, but I can maim real good!
1649	v16603	c97842	3	Time to score me some dick.
1650	v31567	c105803	6	Do you honestly belive that you can get to a "secret internet" by plugging your router into the phone jack?
1651	v21056	c70948	2	WHAT!? No! Why would either of us be fapping our fat cocks? That is just stereotypical and degrading.
1652	v21056	c70948	3	Besides, "Skeleton" is a derogatory term and is problematic. Such beings should prefer to be called corporally challenged.
1653	v21056	c70948	4	Ok, I admit that is a bit strange. But in our politically correct society, who am I to discriminate against a skeleton?
1654	v31393	c98108	7	I'll take a carcass of rotting flesh, extra crispy please.
1655	v31393	c98118	3	Hurr hurr yeah hurr.
1657	v30797	c97698	4	Anyway, the only magic potion you need is tequila.
1661	v30797	\N	2	Thiu walks over Thiu, and thought Thiu hears Thiu coming, Thiu won't move.
1663	v23823	c97631	3	Jeez Bob! Is that a fart?
1664	v7014	\N	4	No, SHE'S terrible! Thanks to her, I murdered someone who wasn't an adorable boy for the first time ever!
1665	v248	\N	6	It seems she wanted to see a crab lose at Rock-Paper-Scissors.
1666	v22270	\N	5	Although Mateo beat and kidnapped me, I suppose it would only be mean spirited to throw him under the bus.
1667	v32555	c100667	2	Please. A beautiful, expensive dress will protect you as armor, I'm sure of it.
1668	v32555	c101351	4	Ah, memories. You were so much cu-- Wait, no you weren't. You definitely weren't cuter. You were curt, and blunt, and really awkward to be around.
1669	v15080	\N	1	We swole, brah!
1670	v68	\N	17	Anyway!! I'm really interested in your mother now!! I'm going to see her sometime. Be prepared!
1673	v42561	\N	4	What the hell did you expect!? She was a baby!
1674	v3144	\N	7	What am I, a cube?!
1675	v3144	\N	26	Tribadism and the end of the world.
1679	v31469	\N	4	Big tiddy...
1680	v23740	c51034	8	And the curry... died.
1681	v27140	\N	11	Men shouldn't play the piano. Men should just shut up and play the guitar.
1682	v37179	\N	12	Heart, Lungs, Liver, Nerves!
1683	v30554	\N	3	You're a perfume virgin, then? <3
1685	v3144	\N	56	Yes. I am full of cum today.
1686	v41858	\N	3	Augh...l-looks like I rolled a one for plot-armor, huh?
1687	v38068	c123831	5	"What do I do? I can't believe I've fallen in love with God!"
1688	v22899	\N	5	I feel warm and fuzzy inside knowing the onahole I created helps so many people masturbate.
1690	v5	c201	21	I catch it with my ass cheeks.
1691	v22987	c74609	4	Fine, then. Keep your secrets...
1692	v2016	\N	11	I deem you good and righteous. Therefore you must die.
1694	v777	\N	7	Figures she'd be the type to survive even if someone kills her. Damn.
1695	v2622	\N	5	But I'm relieved to know that Yukino doesn't hate me. With this, I can sexually harass her later without restraint.
1696	v28146	\N	2	Haaa... Can't believe I nearly hanged myself when we're not even in financial trouble.
1697	v27140	\N	1	I want to be the person chased by the whole world.
1699	v23741	\N	9	H-Hey, Tachibana? What's wrong, calm down! Jerking yourself off at that speed can't be good for your dick...!
1701	v26154	c85480	7	Orimaki, this is the scene where you stay quiet and gaze back at the maiden! Not say, Ah-Ah-Ahh, Oh- Ohhh-Oh!
1702	v26154	c85482	3	Aww, yeah! Hm? Intelligent, cunning...? I-I hope I can pull it off.
1703	v26154	c102674	1	Huh? Ah, hey! I'm not finished talking to you yet, Yonaga! Yonaga... Y-Yonaga just ignored me...?! What's the meaning of this, Tachibana?! Yonaga just ignored me!
1705	v17704	c130314	4	Why would I stare at you? To get a stomachache or something?
1709	v38430	\N	5	Math's not useful if you're dead.
1710	v27448	c87815	20	I detect no signs of intelligent life. Therefore it is logical to assume that Ryuuji is indeed on board
1711	v27448	c87815	7	...Does the world include me?
1712	v2016	c17147	59	Sexual intercourse with a man-sized spider.
1713	v7833	c28259	5	It's basically trash anyway. That's why it reminded me of you.
1714	v7803	c30587	2	Of course I completely beat the crap out of them! HOHOHOHOHO...!
1715	v7803	c12508	3	Anyway, she doesn't strike me as the type to die easily, even if she was killed.
1718	v28810	c95460	1	I swear I would never sexually harass you on purpose!
1719	v18334	\N	9	It's not that rare for you to make a mistake. Your entire existence is a mistake.
1720	v16032	c28307	14	Rejoice, peasant! Enjoy your beloved tsundere content!
1721	v16032	c28304	6	Oh, yes. I'll spend whatever time, effort, or money it takes to bully you.
1722	v716	\N	9	The only time a lawyer can cry is when it's all over.
1724	v711	c10833	10	Thanks to you, I am saddled with unnecessary... feelings.
1725	v51	\N	6	Yep, these 'real faeces chocolates' are really delicious!
1726	v7738	c27730	15	Would you really choose a 2D character over me?
1727	v7738	c27731	17	Aoi's a romance option too, you know. Aoi can get you off, no problem.
1728	v7738	\N	12	God... If I tell her I was looking for clues in a video game, she's gonna kick my ass...
1729	v22	c5677	6	I can't, reach your head, so I patted your bottom...?
1730	v812	c4646	4	A virgin at love! We have a virgin at love here!
1731	v812	\N	4	Guessing from her age and smell, Kana is definitely a virgin.
1734	v4414	c12862	9	Shut up. Please, just shut up. Seeing you worry about me just makes me want to kill myself.
1737	v32555	c100666	2	Are you... Ninja?
1738	v32555	\N	3	I'm not crying! I was just born with weak tear ducts.
1739	v25413	\N	1	Wipe the drool from your face before you talk. It's grossing me out.
1740	v25413	c95243	4	T... Thanks for telling me that. M... More useless knowledge for me to remember.
1741	v25413	c95243	4	T... This is more than I can handle. H... Having seen this, I think I've outlived my usefulness... I... I think I'm going to faint... Goodnight moon...
1743	v25413	c95243	6	I... If you're going to die, do it after we get back home!
1744	v25413	\N	3	If what you say is true... Does that mean that when you danced naked in the dining hall, it wasn't real either?!
1745	v25413	c95243	2	Grrrr... I... Ikeda... H... Hey, would it be alright if I beat her to death?
1747	v25413	c95243	1	I... I think I'm about to drool and pee myself at the same time...
1748	v25413	\N	4	You? Let's see... You're in charge of yelling. Screaming and making everyone nervous. I know you can do it!
1749	v57	\N	9	I wanna grow a bunch of legs when I grow up.
1750	v57	\N	7	Yeah? I can't do that. Don't you think it would be pretty creepy if I went around talking to ants?
1751	v57	\N	6	Get back in the kitchen, woman.
1753	v32555	c100668	6	I view woman younger than me as kawaii imouto. Women older than me meanwhile feel more like reliable older sisters.
1756	v24470	c76170	4	Would you happen to have a blanket? I mean... there's a lot of cords sticking out my butt, right? I know this is necessary for driving, but it's still embarassing...
1757	v24470	\N	2	Don't lump your nipples with my bruises...
1758	v24470	\N	7	You're supposed to announce when you cum. It's only proper respect to the one who made you cum.
1759	v21177	c61592	3	Fucking guys is the easiest thing in the world. There's no merit in having fucked a hundred men. Anyone can do it, if they set their sights on it.
1762	v22145	c106212	1	Oh, you know... Same old, same old... (Get a handjob from my mother before she goes to work... Try to find enough privacy to mess around with aunt...)
1763	v32333	\N	8	REASON: tl;dr, faggot
1764	v15581	c29437	4	Excuse me, what could be the meaning of this "100 consecutive bukkake" that is written over there?
1766	v26262	c93024	4	You wanna get super high and watch cybergoth music videos?
1767	v19655	\N	1	"Flavored chips with Mr Pepper, garnished with P*cky". It could work.
1768	v24294	\N	4	Kyaaah! There's this dirty, grotesque thing between my legs!!!
1769	v903	\N	1	It's 5000 yens for the butt of Kazushi!
1771	v7	c74	8	It'll be all fine if you just kill yourself right here.
1772	v31927	c101688	1	After you got called a clown today? Just how many colors are you wearing, anyway? Seven?
1773	v31927	c101700	1	I should know, I made that heart with these eight fingers of mine.
1774	v31927	c101686	2	Being stupid is my speciality.
1775	v42884	c127993	2	No, the titty monster can take me. I shall die a happy... and proud, man.
1776	v231	c931	3	You know what they call guys who're strong enough to be naive? Heroes.
1777	v57	c1383	2	You cannot change the past or the actions of others, but you can change the future and try to change yourself.
1778	v57	c1387	5	Though it may be only a temporary solution, there is no more effective means of management than violence.
1784	v66	\N	6	It's not human to only ever do what's correct.
1786	v18334	c53207	4	What? You must be a real fuckin' skank to let dudes unload inside you!
1790	v114	c26666	6	My hobby is watching adult videos and my special talent is masturbating!
1791	v13871	c33693	5	We will locate and incapacitate all child molesters across the world. This will be done by a special force under my command.
1792	v13871	c33679	6	I'll order you a truckload of fat negro dick online this evening! That okay with you?
1793	v92	c175	1	Those who show others the way must not avert their eyes from the weight of responsibility.
1794	v99	\N	3	To love someone means to push someone else away.
1796	v97	c68	18	Once you have glimpsed even the tiniest fraction of the world's true face, you have no choice but to watch in horror as the veil rolls itself back inch by inch.
1797	v97	c67	9	Life is like a journey anyway. Nothing stays the same forever. The only difference is whether time passes you by or sweeps you up in its flow.
1798	v777	c3929	17	Wait! It's wrong to kill people!
1799	v42561	c124610	2	Wow, a college student! Men love an educated lady.
1800	v13	c6648	2	I will smite David even to the wall with it...
1801	v21	c3280	8	Doesn't English revolve around the fuck word!? you don't need to speak it at all!
1802	v29345	c97851	14	I'd want a daughter who gets A's on Math tests instead of D's to the face.
1803	v29345	\N	6	Y'know, you remind me of my wife a bit... I WANNA FUCKING KILL MY WIFE!!
1804	v31662	c116931	1	MON DIEU! MY POOR, BROKEN HEART!
1805	v21067	c60500	4	I didn't mean to say that you're some sort of animal that can be lured in with panties like they're a piece of meat.
1807	v4985	c1466	3	Isn't it the new trend to go after herbivorous guys?
1808	v28546	c52310	3	Hm? I thought you said it should be someone trustworthy. Why are you nominating yourself, Barusu?
1812	v33498	\N	3	Stop thinking now, and I can eat you. Free you from yourself.
1813	v33498	\N	2	You don't know where you came from. You don't know where you're going. So what difference does it make where you are now?
1815	v33498	\N	1	Of course, investors do not care about hunger. But diseases, unlike starving people, cannot be kept behind a barbed wire fence.
1816	v33498	\N	2	Are you dumb? Don't chop yourself. Chop the wall. I showed you before.
1817	v33498	\N	5	Amazingly, for a second, I actually believed that you had learned humility. But apparently, you've learned a much more useful skill - keeping your mouth shut.
1818	v33498	\N	5	I can't talk. I'm a horse.
1819	v33498	\N	4	I can always be with you. Would you like to have a pair of my fingers grafted onto you? With them, you'll be able to stroke yourself and think that I'm doing it.
1820	v33498	\N	3	Nature is a monster with a gritted mouth. Covered in blood, reeking of musk. Continuously shouting the same words again and again. Eat others. Breed. Survive. Or die.
1821	v33498	\N	1	Cats don't have the same fast metabolism as rats. And they're cheaper than monkeys. I told them to buy pigs instead, but someone in management was squeamish.
1822	v25566	\N	1	W-Wait, stop, we're not doing this! Demon don't do romance!!
1823	v17159	\N	4	You gave me maracas. You think just because I'm Mexican, I wanna play the maracas?
1824	v28194	\N	3	Lynn feels a little down about choking his brother. But it's not like the little shit died, so he's just being dramatic.
1825	v28194	\N	5	Look, I'm saying neither of them were beaten with sticks! And as far as I'm concerned, that's a happy childhood.
1826	v28194	\N	4	Marrow is screaming because he is a little bitch. I suppose he was surprised seeing the man get stabbed.
1827	v28194	\N	5	None of them fancied the possibility of getting new eye piercings.
1828	v28194	\N	6	I'm not here to visit the remains of some woman who shat us out.
1829	v14520	\N	3	Umm, would you believe me if I said holes are the ones that are attracted to me?
1830	v14520	c17790	7	Our enemy is a woman! That means I simply need to seduce her!!
1832	v14520	\N	1	... Lady Ria, if you deprive him of this, then he will begin talking about capes instead. Please, have some consideration for us.
1833	v14520	c17794	1	A woman's naked form--- In the past, I could buy such spectacles with money.
1835	v14520	\N	1	He's just a stuffed animal now, so he probably won't die from the fall. At worst, maybe there'll be some lasting mental trauma, but that's all.
1837	v7	c72	56	This chair is an eyesore. This chair. This chair. This chair. This chair. This chair. This chair. This chair. This chair. This chair. This chair. This chair. This chair.

1840	v2002	\N	17	But... he's a guy...
1841	v7679	\N	1	Ahh... That suprised me. You're pretty hard, Hajime.
1843	v30797	\N	5	But hey! Look at the bright side! I can finally reach to suck myself!
1844	v30797	\N	1	And if you're not even going to suck my dick, why should I keep you around?
1845	v30797	\N	5	My free stabbing offer has expired! Tooooooo bad!
1846	v30797	\N	1	Except this lump still moves around and has a warm hole! I could fuck it before killing it, y'know?
1848	v33498	\N	1	Do you like hitting other people?...
1849	v33498	\N	2	Familiar suffering is better than fear of the unknown, right? Pain doesn't waste much energy. But worrying about an uncertain future... It sucks you dry.
1850	v33498	\N	1	As for "down below"... Let's just say that when you know what's down there, the desire to see it disappears a bit.
1851	v26262	\N	2	Me, I'm doing fine. My mind's still sharp, I smoke dope, it helps...
1852	v36655	\N	3	...Just gonna point out my momma's from Colombia. You know, before I get 'cracka' assigned as my callsign.
1853	v32144	\N	3	If he feels my boner, I'm dead. I might as well flee the country.
1855	v18344	\N	8	...A pooping puppy is called a pooppy.
1856	v8203	c8566	3	Although we can’t call a woman “Papa”.
1857	v8203	c8561	3	As long as they’re heirloom omelets passed down through generations.
1858	v8203	c8562	7	Ehehe, lasagna, delicious… Lasagnaaaaa, delicioouuussss!!
1859	v37252	c113941	6	But I'm less of your pocket monster and more of your pocket pussy.
1860	v37252	c113941	3	Would any decent human stare so lecherously at the person he just tried to murder?
1861	v37252	\N	5	I refuse to have sex again for the rest of my life.
1862	v11	c15	19	Here I come, king of heroes.... do you have enough weapons in stock?
1864	v29444	c99952	4	Gaya was right... The Dark Web was the way to go.

1874	v2016	\N	28	I LOVE COCKS AND STUFF! NOT THAT I'VE EVER SEEN ONE!
1875	v23741	c71526	12	The important part is you looking disgusted. That's what gets me hard.
1878	v49329	\N	2	And the whole of Alabama rejoiced
1880	v29345	c97851	6	Minor as in "underage", I think my ass is pretty major to be honest.
1881	v29345	c97921	2	Actually, I may or may not have been covered in baby oil.
1882	v29345	c97851	3	...this is a world you and everyone who crochets created.
1883	v31662	c116931	4	I-Iroha, might I kindly ask, what the actual fuck...?
1884	v31662	c116928	3	Even the drunk people remember what happened. Why couldn’t you, Yoruko? Because your brain has more air bubbles than last night’s booze?
1885	v38430	c131018	7	Are those instructions for how to make a bomb? Why's this on the internet?

1905	v711	c3941	10	Let the parrot take the stand.
1906	v717	c3941	12	Oh, I assure you it's quite based.
1907	v3144	c3560	26	It's just... it bugged me how the heroine in this manga wasn't a virgin, so I was gonna burn it and upload the video.
1908	v26532	c85775	10	You think it's true that a tanuki's ballsack can stretch up to 10 square feet?
1911	v5834	c1888	3	I don't like ignoring people. It feels bad when it's done to you, and it feels bad when you do it to someone else.
1912	v5834	c1889	25	Just let her cook.
1913	v22	c5677	1	I feel sleepy-py.
1915	v21289	\N	14	If you read until the end, you'll find a sexy CG of me... doesn't exist. We truly do live in a society. A harsh society. How sad.

1925	v32555	c101347	1	Freedom and joy are foreign to your life. Punishment is all that awaits one born as a witch.
1926	v32555	c101344	7	That is one of her virtues, is it not? Get off of your high-horse and get under my fist, bitch.
1927	v32555	c100666	2	I'm so sorry...! I'll return with a proper written apology momentarily.

1935	v147	\N	6	Here i am, darling. Your dead dad. Don't be surprised if i die again soon.
1936	v92	\N	3	Ugh, I almost don't even wanna turn around...

1954	v18292	c48900	1	I finally understood. The fact that there are no normal people in this world.
1955	v28707	\N	1	And here I thought you were a hopeless, no-good philanderer who would impregnate a woman just by locking eyes with her!
1956	v66	c3665	5	Humans are extinct and you're worried about getting sued?
1957	v45706	c135040	7	You're one of those things. A homestuck.

1969	v28556	c90885	7	You must be the only girl on the planet who'd rather be called an African flightless bird than beautiful or cute.

1982	v7836	c10258	10	I'd have to be a really sad girl to be fantasizing about bird eggs in the school infirmary!

1988	v74	\N	1	......I'm beginning to get angry, Youtia-sama
1989	v74	\N	2	I'd rather be hunting smaller prey though, if you know what I mean... wha, wait, it was just a jokeeeeenguaaaaahhh!!!
1990	v4	c478	6	Yes. The town, the people... we're all family.
1991	v2622	c755	7	How surreal. A spaceship who got scolded by a panda is now crying and begging for rice...
1992	v50	c15	9	Get up, Shinji! Not recognizing your own unfortunate treatment and not reading the mood are your strengths! You know it!
1993	v12402	c45458	24	It felt like I was squeezing an obese rat. I hardly even perceived it as a breast.
1994	v15	c26649	4	I was the tree.
1995	v27032	c91426	4	Looks like we've got this hole under our control. Damned if it wasn't a huge pain in the ass though.
1996	v27032	c88848	11	It's for both our countries, after all. Going to bed with another man is no big deal.
1997	v27032	c88847	9	Mm. Then let us wash one another's backs. This is what men do in a bath.
1998	v27032	c88847	15	Now that we have drank together, the next step is nude camaraderie.
1999	v8701	c15391	12	Don't worry, I don't mind that you're a dirty, jobless, virgin loser. Actually, I prefer it that way!
2000	v16225	c22198	4	Why do I have to sadly watch the guy I like kiss another dude in the opening movie?!?
2001	v15820	c22358	2	I'm the chairman of the tonkotsu ramen research club, y’know!? How could I betray my 20 adorable juniors by joining another club!?
2002	v37795	c113790	5	Don't let him see it! Crush his eyes! ‘Cause your dick belongs to me!!
2003	v26987	c103789	3	That's not true! If I wasn't happy or satisfied with my life with you, I wouldn't have written a story like this. That's why... I'm sorry for forgetting it.
2004	v19035	c88349	11	How was the sex?
2005	v51	c4766	7	I just happened to be looking at your hair when all of a sudden, it started to tear itself up and fall off.
2006	v5	c1864	4	Yep, I am. That's because my breasts go all boing-boing.
2007	v23741	c71531	1	What are you saying Ikuko? I took your crush and now you're jealous? Hehe, that's no good. You should learn to appreciate some NTR too.
2008	v19455	c48431	5	Anyway, having the delusion of being fucked by a man... I guess I'm too hungry!
2009	v27457	c87842	5	Stories have the power to free people’s minds. To interact with a story is to live another life within one’s imagination.

2012	v26344	c130392	5	Having my way with women aside from Kyouko is like the pickles and soup with a bowl of rice. It cleanses the palate. Refreshes it.
2013	v8701	c15391	11	You know, takoyaki kinda look like testicles, don't they?
2014	v8701	c15391	12	If you don't wake up, I'm gonna jam a piece of spaghetti down your urethra. You okay with that?
2015	v8701	c15391	10	Why can't your dick produce something more like whipped cream or pudding or something? Or condensed milk.
2016	v16218	\N	3	Though her breasts are only inches from my face, I can never touch them. Torture like this is beyond inhumane.
2017	v14520	c17790	4	What's the point in studying a maiden's heart? All it'll teach me is how to be needlessly considerate.
2018	v14018	c26321	3	Help me Takuru Miyashiro. You are my only hope.
2020	v19455	c48431	9	Is there a problem? Is it bullying, or is it pregnancy...?

2024	v26414	\N	3	Stop trying to boast about how much of a loser you are.
2025	v26414	c85056	6	Sorry, let me try that again. You're a spineless, chicken-shit wuss.
2026	v26414	c85053	3	But on second thought, I really can't do this. It's almost like there's a second me standing behind my back, staring at me in contempt.
2027	v21552	c62891	1	Wow, you're right. Let's get a closer look, girls, and laugh at him if he's got a pencil dick.
2028	v17516	c33049	5	I see. Well, I wouldn't really mind if you stalked me...
2029	v8820	\N	3	I won't forgive you if you don't roll up your skirt as an apology.
2030	v8820	\N	3	I was wondering what I 'd do if Alice wasn't the only one in your skirt. Thank goodness, I'm relieved.

2032	v4	c6089	13	According to the fortune, Okazaki-san, you have schizophrenia.

2036	v22987	c74609	3	For when you spill your tears, I want you to find yourself in my arms and mine alone.
2037	v11472	c26426	4	You've got to be kidding me! What are you going to do if you take all my worldly desires away? There will be nothing left of me!
2038	v31672	c115941	2	That is a surprisingly human response.
2039	v20189	c88463	2	It doesn't matter whether I take a step backwards or forward, as we were never meant to be linked by the same red strings of fate. The only choice left is to forget.
2040	v21956	\N	4	Wait, what the hell, me? I'm walking around town in broad daylight; this is not the time to be getting horny.
2041	v19073	\N	4	Oh, thanks for the offer, but I won't be needing your mother.
2042	v19073	\N	6	Wahahahahaahh... Th-This is way too fucking fucked! Absolutely fucked fucking!
2043	v20501	\N	3	Mentally, I'm also doing fine — though I did become a primary school teacher, so you might think otherwise.
2045	v26763	c86156	2	This guy likes books with like, pages that are all black and macho men that go "Nnng" and "Mmmm" all the time.
2046	v26532	c85451	7	Wine and underwear are best when aged.
2047	v32021	c99559	5	This isn't a TV show or movie. We don't need to spin things out, or save plot points for next week. You can just tell me.
2048	v20032	\N	15	Ah, the internet, huh. Fuck the internet.
2049	v46917	c129996	2	I just bought you from him for 20 bucks. That means you are mine for the night.
2050	v20600	c3885	5	...Best... H-scene... Ever...
2051	v21552	c62892	4	An eye for an eye, an ahh for an ahh!
2052	v751	c241	19	Okay~ Shake it now, baby now~♪

2055	v19455	c55374	5	I'm ugly. My brain is mediocre. The only talent I have is stupidity...
2056	v21905	c64502	27	You really left her hanging.
2057	v4	c4941	10	Hello! I am pretty dog! Oh! Are you pretty dog too? It's miracle!

2059	v18694	\N	6	Every brother in the whole wide world is a siscon!
2060	v19455	c55375	5	I want to cut out his muscles one by one and slurp them up like spaghetti...
2061	v19455	c48449	7	But... even though he was just born... he's already about to commit a crime!!
2063	v2016	\N	10	When we first met, I had surmised that you were a closet pervert – however, I am surprised to know now that you are a plain pervert – without a single closet.
2064	v2016	\N	4	To remove one’s underwear from the right leg, or the left leg first – do you think that kind of debate is ridiculous?
2065	v11	c15	6	"But… I see, even Mitsuzuri is weak against molesters. I guess that's good. It's impossible to teach her femininity unless something like this happens."
2068	v49763	c135766	3	And there goes my virginity-! Taken by the Goddess of 'All-But-Not-Virgins'! A pretty damn nice first time, huh?!
2070	v12158	c18100	10	· · · ·Damn it, smashing pots and taking the contents were my favorite parts of breaking into people's homes too· · · ·.

2076	v933	c4735	11	50.78% of this world is made out of wrath. The remaining 44.2% is made up of hatred, and another 4.493% is made of excrement.
2077	v933	c4736	12	I jack off, too! Everyone does! So stop acting like your life's a fucking tragedy and grow the hell up!
2078	v7723	c581	9	Knowledge you haven't put to the test is about as useful as a virgin's opinions on women.
2079	v20602	c9895	6	EIGHT CAR GAY NEED SAY!
2080	v12849	\N	2	It's too late... Asuka already has the high ground!
2082	v33130	\N	1	And that's where Project NAM--short for Nab-A-Man--comes in.
2083	v28633	c91339	5	I can really feel the power of your staring. Not because of your gaze, but because of the sound effects.
2085	v16743	\N	2	I'd rather spend my entire life with a monkey.

2094	v12167	c12410	4	Onii-chan... Airi-chan... This feeling of corrupting a relative-
2095	v10419	c36127	4	I don't mind... For the safety of Ojou-sama, no, the entire world... Please dump my body in the non-recyclable trashcan.
2096	v12155	c28280	4	What do you mean by "others"!? Are we just Villagers A and B to you!?
2097	v12155	c22516	3	D-Dream!? What if I'm actually still sleeping in reality and now I'm late for the field trip!?
2098	v17640	c43660	6	Poyo-poyo is poyo-poyo, poyo!
2099	v10162	c34035	3	When we were kids, I used to sneak into my older brother's room and did this a lot. Lock-picking is my specialty, you know?
2100	v5154	c567	12	I love you. I want to make you happy. I also want to sleep with you. In other words, let's have sex. Sounds like a plan...?
2101	v5154	c567	11	I wasn't calling you a dickgirl. Nipples get hard too, idiot.
2102	v5154	c576	6	Please rest assured. Even if you were a phimotic premature ejaculator with the world's most miserable micropenis, my feelings for you wouldn't change.
2103	v2047	c735	12	If you clean toilets properly, you can give birth to cute girls, I hear.
2104	v57	c1383	3	Yo. I'm Morita Kenichi. My life's goal is to manipulate people like tools.

2107	v4251	c98451	1	I've heard that American girls have big boobs, but I didn't expect them to be this big.
2108	v47964	\N	3	Here comes the milkman!
2112	v18149	c41537	6	Could it be that [...] the others are all naked beneath their clothes ?!
2113	v18149	c41534	5	Semen is suppose to go inside a girl's body, right ? That's why I thought it would be wasteful to spit it out.
2114	v18814	\N	3	"Half of what I say is meaningless, but I say it just to reach you."
2117	v1056	\N	5	Oh, this isn't really a big deal, but... Mama ate me. Mama was my Mama. Obviously. She was a little different from normal Mamas... I think.
2118	v1056	c4412	11	What if you mix a boy's name with a girl's...? Like Vander and Gina...
2119	v1056	\N	8	Once upon a time, I lived somewhere with my mom, dad, and older brother. Then we ate my dad and brother. They were tasty. The end.
2122	v19681	c50032	1	Delight IN me?! Not 'delight me,' but 'delight IN me'?!
2124	v19681	c50036	1	This is sudden, but I recently ordered a coffin built for two...
2125	v12455	c15715	4	I don't care if people think I'm a mama's boy, a man that doesn't love its mother, should not be allowed to be called a man, that is something that I'll always defend.
2126	v18162	c50906	2	Anyway, a policeman named Yasu is just hilarious. Like, Yasu's the culprit! Ahahaha!
2127	v12751	c37697	1	I definitely don't think your normal is normal... I can't believe it's fast, accurate and not even partially disturbed.
2128	v12751	c37689	2	A-Anyway, I will take you to the hell of forging, or the purgatory of being obliged for short! You should be honored.
2129	v12751	c37689	2	I've never thought about kissing anyone on the mouth! I hope I will meet someone I would like to kiss on the mouth one day...
2130	v12751	c37689	2	It is unbecoming of me, a cold-hearted messenger of darkness, to try to take away the freedom of a fragile woman like an evil and treacherous emperor!
2131	v12751	c37689	2	I-If, If you insist, I can help you, but... no, I mean, a fallen angel insists on saving you.
2133	v18162	c50717	4	Sorry, but as a young person, it's my privilege to be tired in the morning.
2134	v18770	c42130	3	Huh? Ah... Y-Yes. You can call me Arue or little brat or trash bug or whatever you like.
2135	v25413	c95243	3	L... Life must be hard for you, being such a hopeless cause... S... Shall I give you some of my loose change?
2137	v25413	c95243	3	Y... You don't even wear makeup... J... Just admit that you went there to have a crap...
2139	v25413	c95246	2	I'm sorry... I have a toilet trauma... So, I can't do it here...
2140	v25413	c95246	1	I'm not made out of Play-Doh!
2141	v17018	c29352	11	But I don't want to kiss a mouth that's sucked me off.
2146	v1200	\N	9	Nevertheless, are angels truly sacred?

2158	v42224	\N	5	You were always my favorite meat puppet.
2159	v19843	\N	3	I'd much rather save my first kiss for when you're conscious
2160	v25384	c80974	5	It'd be another story if they were women, but I never asked for a future where traps fought over me!
2161	v25384	c80977	1	I know it's hard to choose, but you might get stabbed if you don't make a choice already.
2164	v17094	c30145	1	You've commited the academic equivalent of a suicide by choosing your hopeless topic, whereas I'm about to be murdered by mine.
2165	v21875	\N	3	Tragically, despite how buff she was, this princess was also cursed to touch a spindle and die.
2167	v24399	c105369	1	He's... he's thankful for my effort! This must be the first time in five years of school. I'm so moved that I put his name first on the project's slide title.
2169	v23070	\N	3	Not that I can put “surprisingly good at eating women out” on my CV or anything...unless I feel like pursuing a very specific career path.
2171	v26920	\N	2	I can just imagine sticking a bunch of poison ivy in my bikini straps.
2172	v26920	\N	3	It's not as romantic as you'd expect, with a feeling like my shoulders are being torn out of their sockets.

2177	v31055	c99589	9	Can I ask you not to look for your father's face in my cunt?
2178	v31055	c136067	3	Irrational, right? This is emotion. It's the same thing, humans and penises.
2179	v26920	\N	3	Hey, as far as I'm concerned, this is what idiots on TV shows eat while drinking their own piss.
2180	v8158	c9361	5	Whew! Verbal abuse is the best!
2181	v16	c27961	1	That's right. Let's catch a cold with the two of us sometime!
2183	v397	\N	1	Wouldn't you mind taking that thing as your wife?
2184	v397	c57	1	There is no idiot who stop when asked to stop!

2189	v3112	c17597	2	Unfortunately, that's the wrong answer. Actually... I'm Santa.
2190	v7836	c10265	1	...you loved me, did you not?
2191	v7836	c10262	9	I shall now become... the very concept of pudding itself.
2192	v10570	c10263	5	What is this lunacy!? Do you mean to tell me that bombing school buildings is common practice in this barbaric land!?
2193	v711	c10833	5	I was hoping to come up with a question while I was objecting, Your Honor... I didn't.

2486	v18760	c41751	2	It's only when he sees cute girls like me that his dick, that's usually hidden by a layer of fat on his belly, rises like a tower.
2487	v16640	c32069	5	I'd almost say we've been blessed by the god of implausible erotic situations or something.
2488	v30394	c95740	4	If you asked me to choose between saving a forest and saving a woman... I would ask you if there were any women in the forest.
2489	v30394	c95740	3	The responsible babysitter hands me the baby she's supposed to be sitting. There's nothing questionable about this transaction at all.
2490	v30394	c95747	4	I was just about to livetweet me dying.
2491	v18157	c92028	2	HOLY FUCKING SHIT FUCKING SHIT SONUVABITCH!
2492	v13325	c17470	4	Wait a second please. Nii-san only recently grew out of his diaper phase; I don't think he's ready to get married yet.
2493	v57	c1383	3	Yeah, I agree. I'm completely perfect. That stuff about not being able to handle sexual situations? A total joke. Seriously.
2495	v47645	c131586	2	Of freakin course this pretty girl in front of you is the same as any human! I go pee, I sweat, I also cum love juice and suck on cocks like any humans do!
2496	v6639	\N	3	You can't just go around discovering people's holes!
2497	v14062	\N	3	As God said, "Be fruitful and multiply".
2498	v14062	\N	5	I won't accept guys who aren't all about homosexuality.
2499	v14062	\N	4	Love us like the fishburger loves its fried fish!
2500	v3144	\N	11	If it ended here, this would be a kusoge!!
2502	v21782	c64024	6	Maybe I went too far in showing you our torture chamber. I'm sorry.
2503	v7853	\N	5	Ah... This is such a nice city... I was walking down this street last night when a group of harpies raped me.
2504	v14062	\N	3	Err, I mean, kindly kill yourself, valued customer
2505	v43470	c124877	2	I'm licensed to handle raw meat.
2507	v43470	c124877	5	Oh? You don't love parties where by the end someone tries to kill you?
2509	v26414	c85054	3	That time my late-blooming older childhood friend was reincarnated in another world as a cunning playboy!
2510	v1552	c5094	7	I'm not so brazen as that! Really, I'm not! I'm no maid strumpet!
2511	v1552	c5103	2	Hehehe... Being able to legally beat this slime... ah, the pure joy!
2512	v1552	c5092	4	Like she finally lost it and slipped into a maid-themed axe rampage
2513	v1894	c6232	2	If you really, really feel strongly about someone, and want to make them happy... You need to doubt them just as much as you trust them.
2514	v20	c5318	2	Being kind without reference to time, place and occasion is annoying. Hiding behind words of kindness is just being afraid of hurting someone.
2515	v751	c267	4	Good and evil don't matter. To me, what's right is simply what's most precious to me.
2516	v1474	c3930	3	If you hesitate when asking a question, you're probably better off not asking. When you feel the time is right to ask, they'll tell you of their own accord.
2517	v4028	\N	7	They showed a drawing of two beautiful men... doing things like -retracted-, -retracted- and even -retracted-
2518	v1200	\N	12	I once smeared mustard on a cat's anus
2519	v734	c87821	3	Love is about thoughtfulness, affection, and LUST!
2520	v51	c4766	3	The moment the exams end, my intelligence drops like a rock.
2521	v51	\N	4	She opens her mouth in a 'Hauuu~' kind of way.
2523	v50	c33	4	Hooh aherhooh, you hwo, munchmunch.
2524	v23740	c67682	4	There is nothing greater in this world than tiny, flat, minuscule breasts.
2525	v18077	\N	5	You humans are like that sometimes, aren't you? Occasionally emotion, not logic. Violence, not dialogue. Those are closer to the truth for you all.
2526	v1917	c4457	1	Mari is bad end
2527	v12849	c22767	2	I feel like just thinking of strawberries can get me through any hardships.
2528	v12849	c22768	7	Why would I pay for that when I could just punch you and take your money?
2529	v44662	c126514	2	One-thousand and one ways to bang your mom.
2530	v33	c2937	1	You're still a child until you can solve a cubic equation without any problem.
2531	v20330	c55337	4	There's no morning wood even though it's morning. Can I even call it the morning without that?
2532	v3660	c18377	6	Being naked in a chapel with your butt sticking out - who would do something like this?
2533	v3660	c18382	3	...My finger is in your asshole. I understand.
2535	v14265	c70186	3	There are plenty of girls that are into glasses! This is a positive trait you naked eyed savage! You should be embarrassed walking around in public like that!
2536	v26523	c60020	4	Small titties or big, if they're titties, I want to fondle them. It's what brings me joy.
2537	v11856	c21354	2	It's lunch break, and we were bored, so we figured we'd gang up and attack Genki
2538	v17038	c33066	2	"*chew* Wow. You really captured that... plastic flavor?"
2539	v14018	\N	4	Those eyes are God's eyes?
2540	v13325	c17470	5	Whoa whoa whoa! Everyone's being so dirty and shameless! If this keeps going any longer my ears are gonna get pregnant!
2541	v29383	\N	2	This is what makes a man a creature! I'll cut off that grotesque crotch right now!!
2542	v14934	\N	2	I'm not sure if this is a medical procedure, but it's ok! I've disinfected it well... with spit!
2543	v16032	c28299	6	ALIIIICE!!! YOU FREELOADING SCUM!!! PAY YOUR RENT!!! YOU DEAD WEIGHT LOSER!!!
2544	v57	c1374	2	NEETs haven't been working much lately, have they?
2545	v57	c1383	3	I am unfamiliar with the recreational habits of peasants, so I'll leave it up to you guys to figure out what to do.
2546	v57	c1385	4	I'm not going bald... I'm not going bald! No... This is EVOLUTION...!
2547	v57	c506	2	I don't mind what we do as long as I can space out...
2548	v57	c1383	2	The texture is grass-like because you're eating grass!
2549	v57	c1383	2	I'll... r-r-rape youuuuu...
2550	v57	c1374	4	Farewell, my beloved son. Love, dad... P.S... Playstation.
2551	v57	c1385	3	I-I failed the psychiatric evaluation, so I can do something like this without being considered a criminal, okay!?
2552	v17102	c6493	3	Whoops, got too serious. Need to slip back into shitpost mode.
2553	v24132	c77062	5	For now, my anus has firmly protected my chastity.
2554	v24132	c77063	5	I'm sure one day... you'll fall in love with me for real...
2555	v36246	c112592	2	I struggle with my rapidly melting Love Lotion and finally slurp the last of it in my mouth
2556	v14934	\N	2	I wonder if there are any jobs that pay for sticking your head in a beautiful woman's freshly undressed underwear basket.
2557	v33493	\N	9	🙏BLESS🙏
2558	v33493	\N	10	what if i used my super chat money to buy a vibrator

2561	v15070	c26871	2	(I-I'm even famous enough for a cat to know about me ...)
2564	v12849	c22768	7	Giving your virginity to the great blue sea, now that sounds poetic. Bit too poetic for me though.
2565	v24717	c64309	3	I can't believe I had the deepest orgasm of my life from the slightest touch.
2566	v29345	c97860	1	Yo what's up this is Kylar, let's break this gay ass photo lab!
2567	v37651	c5103	5	Well, that's a shame for you! It's not a 'surprise I've actually got big ones!' situation with me
2568	v1552	c5090	3	Again with the 'nothing?' It has to be something sometime.
2569	v19035	c88345	2	I paint the desires hidden deep in the human heart.
2575	v21956	c65109	1	Yasumasa - HOUSE
2576	v26344	c130392	1	Your breasts and thighs are so plump, even as young as you are. You've got child-bearing hips, and your scent makes—
2577	v21269	c65711	9	Shit! I was at the mercy of a guy who thought ass play was the norm!
2578	v21269	c65711	8	Well, shit. The cock was definitely out of the bag.
2579	v2002	c6498	4	Leave this task to Hououin Kyouma! I shall open this door with precision, boldness and delicacy, as if it were the flesh of a beautiful woman!
2581	v29443	\N	4	So you want a brain? Yes.
2582	v29443	\N	3	Then I hope they have air conditioning wherever we're going.
2583	v29443	\N	5	At first I dismissed that as a bug...but maybe it's a feature.
2584	v21269	c65711	7	Why is it only ever guys who ask me to hang out?
2585	v24202	c109868	2	True intimacy is when you don't know what will happen next or how your partner will treat you. Otherwise, it's just masturbation.
2586	v21523	c62881	2	I just fucked my sister
2587	v750	\N	2	At home I'm just my little sister's toy. And outside I'm treated as a small fry.
2588	v21523	c62879	6	Have you ever jacked off to your little sister?
2589	v27448	c89233	2	I've learned the true meaning of loving hamburgers.
2590	v15070	c26871	2	"You're talking to the one who had three servings of breakfast this morning. Should I really be considered a woman at this point?"
2591	v19917	c65344	2	Well, the lieutenant's... inside my belly.
2592	v19917	c65341	1	He must be struggling to not contract his asshole so he won't crush the berries up there.
2593	v21523	c62879	4	It's only natural for a big brother to pleasure himself with his little sister, after all
2594	v473	\N	4	If you said you couldn't eat it, I was going to slice your stomach open and stuff it in myself
2595	v14062	\N	2	It seems that Apollo 13 won't be rendezvousing for docking maneuvers tonight.
2596	v14062	\N	4	My story is rock-hard right now.
2597	v14062	\N	3	Talk about disappointment. Failure, failure and failure.
2598	v50731	c137859	1	You can't say you're sorry and then just immediately go back to doing the thing you were sorry about!
2599	v50731	c137858	1	I'm just going to stop you right there. Please stop theorizing. Your theories are always the most, mind the pun, bat-shit insane things I've ever heard.
2600	v12402	c45460	1	(She definitely thinks i'm obnoxious... Argh, i want to hide under a rock. I want to reverse time and try this over again!)
2601	v12402	\N	1	People prefer an open book to a face of stone.
2602	v27448	\N	2	And thus the Crab Worshipper's Association Summer Party- Err, Atri's birthday party begins.
2603	v716	c14338	2	A fool's fool fools fools who foolishly accept the foolishness of a fool's fool.
2604	v38067	c94431	1	I can join you guys…but I fall asleep in 5 seconds
2605	v38067	c94428	1	Scien, Scien! Let’s talk about love when we are going to bed. Do you have any women you’re interested in?
2606	v50742	c137879	1	“Is it going to harm me in any way? Are you going to use my body as- as fuckin’ plant food or something?”
2607	v183	c7177	5	Things like voice and appearance don't matter. If someone is truly important to you... then the tiniest part of them is enough.
2608	v21405	c63866	1	Being happy can be somewhat bittersweet, isn't it?
2609	v3144	c3560	13	Infinite ejaculation.
2610	v22299	c95806	3	That's not what a counselor should do. She should be kind and supportive to build your confidence in yourself, not cruel and judgmental to destroy it.
2611	v17863	\N	4	Just as there is always light in darkness, in every great man lies a touch of feminity.
2612	v17863	\N	3	You need to find both the right incentive and the right timing to kill yourself. Just like confessing to your first crush, wouldn't you say?
2613	v17863	\N	3	Compared to them, we men are just useless poop factories.
2614	v17863	\N	3	So maybe we shouldn't go as far as to say we're 'killing ourselves' but instead, that we're 'rejuving our lives.'
2615	v47740	c135375	1	Oi oi... did you two forget you're not alone here?
2616	v18077	\N	2	Future...? That's the most useless of all. I never had one of those to begin with.
2617	v470	\N	2	Of course, my cock got rockhard
2618	v41700	\N	2	I knew love is blind, but I never thought it's deaf too!
2619	v41700	\N	2	Mummy! It's those two face-sucking perverts again!
2620	v41700	\N	2	This is totally not gay.
2621	v41700	\N	2	Guess both you and our Palmier have shitty taste in men.
2623	v473	\N	4	Don't look at me with those nasty eyes. You'll impregnate me, so don't look at me, perv
2624	v5	c193	2	A Kansai man came and burned off my notebook with a beam of light.
2625	v661	\N	1	When I realized that I was not only trapped, but naked, I felt like I wanted to cry.
2626	v661	\N	1	I quess I should've checked the weather report before taking a shower. Not that anyone would ever expect a typhoon to strike them in the shower!
2627	v661	\N	1	"We're being watched..." A.) Panicked, I made sure my hair looked perfect.
2628	v661	c135840	1	Nami, let's qo to the beach next month! You can wear a bikini! A G-string bikini!
2629	v661	\N	1	"It's a poltergeist." I said, with a shudder. "What's a poltergeist?" "A geist that polters!"
2630	v21523	c63418	7	I can always give a play-by-play of your last sex session if you prefer.
2632	v1896	\N	1	Everyone realizes it at some point. Nothing in the real world ends with a nice little "they lived happily ever after."
2633	v139	c20936	3	I wish this idiot has just smashed his head against the Berlin Wall and died!
2634	v12711	c38505	2	Tsk... Despite having a big cock, you're pretty strict about such things
2635	v661	c135885	1	I'm not qoing to just drop it! Somebody just plants a kiss on my boyfriend in the dark? I'm not just gonna sit back and accept it. I'm gonna object to that, of course!
2636	v661	\N	1	Nami raced to the stairs with the same fury as when she got into a fight with a police officer on a motorcycle.
2637	v661	\N	1	I imagined Nami taking a shower in here... Who wouldn't get psycho!? Uh, I mean who wouldn't get psyched?
2638	v661	c135840	1	What do you call a rhinoceros before it rains? A DRY-noceros!
2639	v661	c135840	1	I know. You've got no reason to want to kill me... Not yet, anyway!
2640	v18852	c45358	5	"What motivates people is not despair, but love."
2641	v18852	c45356	6	"Maybe it would be better for me to start as your slave, and slowly work my way up to being your friend..."
2642	v18852	c45356	2	"You're turning into a normie... just like the rest of them..."
2643	v1896	\N	2	Being exposed to daily psychological assaults from an anime-tier childhood friend would raise any human's endurance.
2644	v561	\N	3	First up is the piss drinking diet!
2645	v9205	c15448	2	Dunce, coward, chicken, insect, dimwit, trash, loser, hack, octopus, squid, tuna, salmon...!
2646	v38552	c116221	3	Oh good, you’re awake. I was beginning to worry I’d have to eat you again already.
2647	v49523	\N	3	She was hungry and he dressed as a bottle of ranch dressing...beginner’s mistake.
2648	v49523	\N	3	And here I am, narrating cheap yandere porn, only to get a paycheck to feed my goose.
2649	v49523	\N	2	If you want me to become a catboy, I will become one. If you want me to be a cuckold, I’ll watch you have sex with someone else.
2650	v661	\N	1	"Fires and fights are the flowers of Edo!" I said, as I jumped into the skies above the eight hundred and eight neighborhoods of Oedo.
2651	v661	\N	1	"Uh, what do you think you're grabbing there?" "Oh, yuck!" "Don't worry. It's just my thumb."
2652	v661	\N	1	As the narrator of Otogirisou, I felt it was time to mix in some concentrated lovin' and initiate my special plan.
2653	v661	\N	1	I wore the panties I found earlier as a helmet.
2654	v661	\N	1	Nami threw the picture down. It was a picture of Nami and I with our arms wrapped around each other, and we were naked.
2655	v20424	c55090	4	The people of this island have a blind faith in woks…
2656	v15	c26840	1	Keep going on forever. To a place where you can no longer clearly see this summer's end.
2657	v14265	c19044	2	...I think, a creator is someone who creates a new era.
2658	v31002	c97053	2	But I'm curious. Are you the cucker or the cuckee in this scenario?
2659	v561	\N	5	If you can't realize how others feel, you should just... just get eaten by lasagna!
2660	v6985	c735	6	Girls should be treasured. I'm a feminist, you know.
2661	v12849	c22769	2	Oh no, I wouldn't dare wonder how someone whose name means window could be so bad at cleaning them.
2662	v30216	c95825	1	Aioi-san, how can someone as careless as you be with President Jinbo? Are you actually someone incredible...?
2663	v30216	c95825	1	If President Jinbo says so, it must be right.
2664	v30216	c95823	1	We're a lot alike. Maybe it's time we started getting closer.
2666	v25725	c89392	1	Once, I struggled with emotions. My power spiraled with my heart. In the human world, with friends, I found stability. A century later, it still feels like yesterday.
2667	v29345	\N	1	"...so I'm pretty sure the photography teacher's a white nationalist.""I said "the tuna's good today" and you just replied with that."
2668	v11762	c138089	1	Nukes are only effective when you use them for bluff. Once you've actually used them, it's over.
2669	v11762	c138083	1	What are you talking about? Physical intimacy is extremely important in building teamwork.
2671	v661	c135885	1	I remember when I was a kid, and I peeked through this keyhole!
2672	v661	\N	1	There he was. A naked man, crawling on his belly. He had stretched out his arm as far as he could, and was pulling on the edge of her skirt.
2673	v661	\N	1	Light began to shine from underneath her clothes, making her nude figure shine through what she was wearing.
2674	v661	\N	1	I thought... Did she find that little secret I'd hidden in my bag? Is that why she screamed?
2675	v661	\N	1	Undeterred, I gave Nami's buns a pat as I passed through the gate.
2676	v42561	\N	2	She was stepped on...?
2679	v15575	c19867	1	I’m Iljime born as an ume flower.
2680	v29345	c132567	2	Forgive me father for I have sinned. Please make these urges go away, my cousin is not hot, my cousin is not hot...
2683	v25366	c80819	1	If you want, I can chew it for you and feed you mouth-to-mouth.
2684	v38100	\N	2	Why do I have to spend money on that weird-ass horse?
2685	v38100	\N	3	My butt's gonna explode if I get on a horse!
2686	v38100	\N	3	I'm going to call it "Handsome Horse Ranch Water"!
2687	v25385	c88824	1	Maybe it's an alien spy creature camouflaged as a necktie
2688	v481	c979	2	Yeah. You look like the town bicycle that everyone's already had a ride on.
2689	v10016	c22027	1	No, that's not it... I want your underwear.
2690	v38100	\N	5	I've heard that weird girls born in the Year of the Horse sometimes see horses as attractive men (there are several theories to explain this).
2692	v25366	c80819	1	Her hair smelled like your shampoo. Guilty.
2694	v124	\N	2	There's no such thing as fate that rules the future. Fate is a name we give to the past to comfort ourselves.
2695	v124	\N	3	Still, it's in his character to ass-fuck someone for interfering with his work.
2696	v139	c2204	3	Er... there are heavily-breathing macho men in the emerald green lake... I just thought you should know...
2697	v22505	\N	5	Holy fucking jawfoieoj she really wasn't wearing a skirt!
2698	v25583	\N	6	I mean. You have no value other than rolling over and showing us your belly like a fucking dog, you animal.
2699	v25583	\N	6	Then fucking die, you hopeless idiot!! You absolute fucking moron, you walking pile of diarrhea!!
2700	v1241	\N	4	Yeah... It hurts so much, I wish I'd been born a woman.
2701	v18149	\N	5	I'm primed to awaken a fetish for verbal abuse.
2702	v18149	\N	4	If there's a hole, I'm going to want to try sticking my dick in it. That's how guys are.
2703	v46744	c129244	1	A big brother's butt belongs exclusively to his younger sister.
2704	v18149	\N	3	Even when horny, a true gentleman should be able to show self-restraint.
2705	v18149	\N	3	I'm a guy! My eyes are gonna be drawn to bouncing tits, no matter how hard I try to resist! It may as well be a law of nature!
2706	v717	c14171	2	All sorts of things come out of my panties!
2707	v20177	\N	3	DICK. WE DIDN'T GRAB ANY DICKS!
2708	v20177	\N	3	My boyfriend has the best nipples in the world. They're MEATY. They have enhanced flavor! They taste like- Pizza!
2709	v20177	\N	2	And yes, he WAS a Doctor- he finished like half of both of his doctorates before he got kicked out! That totally counts!
2710	v20177	\N	3	Well then, hurry up and find that penis!
2711	v20177	\N	3	Get the shovel, I'm going to show that asshole what happens when you piss off a scientist.
2712	v23448	c75723	4	Besides, all men think about is how they can shove their Tower of Babel into a woman's Garden of Eden.
2713	v26344	c130392	1	It seems strange that you would be uncomfortable washing my back when you hump me so often.
2714	v19073	c57808	1	Besides, isn't "ghosting" your employer popular with the youth these days? I don't want my inn to become haunted.
2715	v19073	c44770	3	So you have an interest in men, Master... I didn't expect that.
2716	v19073	c44769	2	I never even knew that edging with urine was an actual fetish!
2717	v20177	\N	3	It's his 128 pack. I figured that the more packs you have, the sexier you are. So I added a lot.
2718	v20177	\N	3	I can't believe you actually found weird-tentacle-dick appropriate pants.
2719	v19073	c44772	2	Wh-What's going on, Onii-chan? Why do you have a harem now!?
2720	v43438	\N	2	"Andrew! W-weren't you supposed to be masturbating?"
2721	v29345	c97921	1	So again, while I find the notes flattering, the boys need to quit writing "bad bitch" on my office door. I'll start tracking who left them if it continues.
2722	v29345	c97851	2	Is there an app that'll make you fuck off and kill yourself?
2723	v44358	c97851	1	I'm your girlfriend. I pay for your Five Guys, he wants to put his dick in a child-- how am I getting outclassed here??
2725	v44358	c97851	1	What girl would respond emotionally enough to a suicidal guy begging to jack off to her?
2726	v17064	c138376	1	Mr. Sun is hitting hard... I guess I don't need my clothes!...
2727	v19073	c44771	2	Does Masaomi have a fetish for mosaics!?
2728	v26414	c85054	1	Will you run this shrine with me, and spend the rest of your life working like a dog to support me?
2729	v26773	c87471	1	Good. That'll do. Workship me, for the rest of your life. You're never coming back. El Strain Marba--
2730	v16802	c41440	1	I really haven't got a fucking clue
2733	v16802	c41440	1	They only harassed you because you've got such great tits.
2734	v6710	\N	1	What?! In a hurry to rape me?!
2735	v18690	c43354	3	You're my muse, after all! I can't go for too long without seeing you or I start feeling restless, so every now and then I wake up early and watch your house.
2737	v11	\N	1	Sakura gapes at me.
2738	v3144	c3559	6	I know a person who always tries to do the scenario, drafting, CG, acting and backgrounds all by himself just because he can.
2739	v19073	c44769	4	Imagine if I turned into a dog in the middle of us, um, having sex...
2740	v629	c20145	3	Why do you exist?! Why?!
2741	v10588	c6635	1	Hey, can't a guy rub mayonnaise all up on his bro without getting interrupted?
2742	v3144	c62386	8	...Your dreams are retarded.
2745	v7426	c138487	1	I was looking for you, Romano.... why are you stripping yourself? Is it siesta time?
2746	v29443	c99957	1	Curry is the flavour of happiness
2748	v7426	c138413	1	Well, fear can make you run like a rabbit with his tail on fire.
2749	v7426	c138410	1	Really?! I thought that everyone knows about "Austria's lover steals his aristocratic pants" thing.
2750	v7203	c25583	1	A swimsuit, an armor or just a leaf - Berry-chan will look cute in everything!
2753	v22505	c4656	4	Bishi!
2754	v2153	c13709	3	I... Furudo Erika... have DUCT TAPE!!
2755	v2153	c13709	2	Without love, it cannot be seen? Hah. That's backwards. Because of love, you end up seeing things that don't even exist.
2756	v34022	c89450	2	We do as we wish. That’s the demon way.
2757	v26999	c87638	1	I fear neither death... nor pain. The only thing I fear is my loss of my pride!
2758	v26999	c87638	1	If you just came to chat, then do me the favor of directing it to the wall.

2762	v13	c6642	1	If there's a logical explanation for something, then I'll believe it, but if there isn't one, I... will choose the most romantic option.
2763	v751	c304	3	WHAAAAAAAAAAAAAT IS YOOOOOOOOOOOOUTHHHHH?!?!?!
2764	v25914	c64023	1	"Yang sometimes attacks me out of nowhere... I want him to stop."
2765	v25914	c64020	1	"This is all your fault! The only reason you're the boss is because everyone likes you!"
2766	v19397	c49572	2	"Are you sure? I'm serious this time. I really will fuck you this time."
2767	v32333	\N	2	Allow me to introduce myself: I'm a fucking asshole.
2768	v25197	\N	3	Crow raises his hand for a high five, but laptops don't have hands.
2769	v25197	c81183	2	"You're correct. Stupid, but correct."
2770	v32333	\N	2	You know, the problem with you isn't that you're a gutless, craven pussy who can't get off their ass. No, your problem is that you have too much stuff.

2772	v17018	c29350	3	Yeah. There's no demand for cross-dressing frogs.
2774	v1474	\N	1	Kosame-san, you have a right to fall in love with me, based on the potatoes alone.
2775	v37469	c112999	9	Don't talk to my dick!
2776	v18778	c41742	3	Huh? We're going to run to a love hotel...?
2778	v37469	c113001	3	We've taken baths together, but I've haven't really seen your butthole very well. I'm looking forward to it...!
2779	v37469	c112999	4	This tastes a lot like science...
2780	v1660	c2848	1	Why? Isn't it normal for an older brother to lose his virginity with his younger sister?
2781	v1863	\N	2	Become a chair and shut up!
2782	v28286	c89817	1	I knew it, the best women out there are little sisters!
2783	v28286	c89817	1	Hyaaah?! P-Please do not touch me there!
2784	v25197	c81183	1	"Having a picture of a cat on your phone can come in handy when talking to girls."
2785	v25914	c64021	2	"Unbelievable! If I wanted to kill you, I wouldn't have passed you a note like we were in middle school!"
2786	v777	c3929	1	I saw a pig in the woods picking up leaves before.
2788	v25197	c81184	1	"Isn't that great, Teuta? We've decided on Teuta's name. Right, Teuta? Do you like that name?"
2789	v10231	c6510	1	Isn't that what romantic comedies are, though? The main guy is super popular with every girl for no reason at all!
2790	v10231	c6507	1	In drama, trivial concerns such as age and social standing are cast aside.
2791	v10231	\N	1	Yo, isn't this like, really bad? I mean, your romantic partner is an elementary school girl...and an evil spirit, to boot!
2792	v10231	\N	1	I-Is this...real, live tentacle play?! That's amazing... Rrrg, no, it isn't!
2793	v10231	c11272	2	No, I think in this day and age, the preferred choice is to add in some BL instead.
2794	v901	c55321	1	I told you I’m a tits addict. I enjoy them.
2797	v1399	c18364	2	I'll be more careful next time, i promise. Just make sure you eat, like, actual food, okay?
2798	v1399	c18365	2	Not everyone lives to eat.
2799	v1399	\N	3	Zenya was screaming for no reason.
2800	v19818	c86240	1	—I wanted to be a whale.
2801	v1306	\N	1	Fight me... If you win, I'll give you my virginity.
2804	v22505	\N	1	Damn it... I wasn't into this S&M shit at all... If only I could hit "Decline" on this RP invite...
2805	v13188	\N	2	I have no recollection of allowing you to touch my husband with your filthy hands!
2806	v1194	\N	2	because it's what some unknown person decided?
2808	v28834	c91894	1	I'll start crying between my legs...
2809	v15125	c83949	1	To your future career in the circus.
2810	v734	c72956	2	I'm a lover not a liar. It takes huge tits to be a liar.
2813	v25197	c81176	2	"If your mouth feels that lonely, then suck on one of these."
2814	v21782	c64021	1	"Don't you know the saying? A man gifts a woman clothes that he wants to take off."
2815	v24241	c74512	2	"Can you tell me more about how intercourse works?"
2816	v24241	c87446	2	"Hey, bad to see you again."
2817	v22230	c66156	1	When people say "It's about someone I know" or "It's about my friend", it's about themselves most of the time.

2820	v22	\N	1	The dead cannot speak.
2821	v22	c5818	1	By any chance, is that old fogey... an M?
2822	v22	c5818	1	Why are you slapping me on the butt?
2823	v22	c5677	1	Was there some song with the lyric "oon-oon-oon?"
2825	v25197	c81176	3	"I'm not crying. I'm just checking my mascara's water resistance."
2826	v37469	c112999	2	If you hum at night, snakes will appear.
2828	v18717	\N	1	You have chosen the path of hardship, haven't you ?
2829	v18717	\N	1	Yeah.. That's the kid I know
2830	v18717	\N	1	So please don't forget. You are not... And you will never be... Alone.
2831	v3144	c3566	2	Sickness comes from the mind. Flat chests do, too.
2832	v47275	c138874	2	I was so busy avoiding the branches that I just ran face first into that tree.

2835	v11660	c6493	1	There's no debating that Nae-sama was born from my belly!
2836	v14265	c19047	1	We're kidnapping her!
2837	v27448	c87815	1	Time is a cruel thief to rob us of our former selves. We lose as much to life as we do to death...
2838	v29144	c92790	1	...What? Don't be silly. We can't use time travel to explain anything.
2839	v29144	c92785	1	I'm trying to sympathize with you, but it's not easy when you're pointing that knife at me.
2840	v29144	c92786	1	Mom, Mister Akaro is a nice man. Can he be my new daddy?
2841	v29144	c92785	3	Right. I'm so smart that I turn myself on.
2842	v29144	c92788	1	I'm really going to lose it. I have no idea how I've gone through all of this without losing it already.
2843	v33504	\N	1	Do what must be done, do whatever you want to do. Not because you were ordered to, but because you’re free to do as you wish.

2847	v18778	c41742	3	Everyone has some part of them that's an act... and I think the acting's just part of what makes us who we are.
2848	v45496	\N	1	It's... It's nothing! Don't pick up on people's monologues without permission!
2849	v45496	\N	1	Have you made any progress with the prince you're hunting?
2850	v17064	\N	1	It's not right to be gone at such a young age! Don't you dare give up now, or you'll be sorry!
2851	v17064	\N	1	If you feel scared on the battlefield, just remember my beautiful face! That'll soothe your mind.
2852	v37592	c113481	1	Now, now, Ankora, don't you know there are three things you must never ask a woman? Her income, her three sizes, and how she died!

2875	v933	c4735	1	So filthy. Peel back that thin layer of skin, remove that thin veneer of respectability, and they're all the same. Bestial sacks of organs.
2876	v19035	c88345	1	Well, congrats on the sex.
2877	v26721	\N	2	–This drill is about to shish kabob her vagina.
